Admittedly, I had been slacking and made it a point to step up my game. I did and she said even told me so. Now fast forward to that Christmas.\n\nWe typically have a rule that for Christmas and birthdays we give gifts that the other person wouldn't buy for themselves. But for that Christmas, she wanted to get less expensive gifts. Which would have been fine if she taken the time consider a good gift.\n\nNeedless to say I was extremely disappointed in my gifts. One was bottle of body wash called Ballwash and the other was a $50 gift card. I should mention that my love language is \"receiving gifts\" and this hurt me on a couple levels. One was that we had not been intimate in several months and I immediately took this as her making fun of that. Which in turn was making fun of me. Another was that I thought she changed our Christmas tradition just so she did not have to think about anything I liked doing. She couldn't be bothered to spend anytime thinking about me or what I liked doing. I carried that pain/anger/hurt for over a month. I was so mad at her, I contemplated ruining her birthday by giving her some equally awful gift.\n\nBut my better judgement prevailed and I sat her down to talk about it. There were some tears and misty eyes but I had to tell her or I would have never let it go. During that conversation I told her that for my birthday (which is a fast follow after Christmas) I wanted a particular accessory for one of my hobbies. Now while she didn't exactly what I wanted, she at least tried. Now let's get to this past Christmas.\n\nIn order to avoid the previous Christmas' fiasco, I started sending Christmas lists to her on the regular. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc. There were plenty of highly detailed and specific gifts of varying price points. And since I started sending them to her in September, she had plenty of time to fit me in her schedule. \n\nNow since we share an Amazon account, I can see whenever she orders something. I knew she was getting me a particular tool off the list not only from the order confirmation but she asked me about it two days before that. I was feeling a little down that the surprise was ruined but I was getting a new tool. \n\nChristmas day rolls around and it's my turn to open gifts. New tool? Yup. Sweet. I'm thinking that's it because typically stockings are just decoration. But she had our two year old run mine to me. Inside was a map with instructions on where to find the next gift. So me and my son go on a scavenger hunt for all these little gifts scattered around the house. The last gift was a gift card for the accessory I had wanted the previous Christmas. She even said she got similar one at a local store but returned it when she did a little more research into it thinking that it was wrong. She asked me if the first one was correct and I told her either would have been fine. \n\nI teared up a little because she did a fantastic job of making me feel special and that she actually was willing to put in the time for me. She showed me that affection is not a one way street and she was willing to do the things that would make me happy. I'm still giddy about it becuase it was so much fun. \n\nTLDR; learn how your partner receives love and you'll both be happier.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1578971869, "gildings": {}, "id": "feceb12", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eob5yh", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_fec7h7b", "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/eob5yh/what_is_something_every_woman_should_know_about/feceb12/", "retrieved_on": 1578988699, "score": 251, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ITriedLightningTendr", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2i104q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "The love language book is a pretty good read for that.
