Admittedly, I had been slacking and made it a point to step up my game. I did and she said even told me so. Now fast forward to that Christmas.\n\nWe typically have a rule that for Christmas and birthdays we give gifts that the other person wouldn't buy for themselves. But for that Christmas, she wanted to get less expensive gifts. Which would have been fine if she taken the time consider a good gift.\n\nNeedless to say I was extremely disappointed in my gifts. One was bottle of body wash called Ballwash and the other was a $50 gift card. I should mention that my love language is \"receiving gifts\" and this hurt me on a couple levels. One was that we had not been intimate in several months and I immediately took this as her making fun of that. Which in turn was making fun of me. Another was that I thought she changed our Christmas tradition just so she did not have to think about anything I liked doing. She couldn't be bothered to spend anytime thinking about me or what I liked doing. I carried that pain/anger/hurt for over a month. I was so mad at her, I contemplated ruining her birthday by giving her some equally awful gift.\n\nBut my better judgement prevailed and I sat her down to talk about it. There were some tears and misty eyes but I had to tell her or I would have never let it go. During that conversation I told her that for my birthday (which is a fast follow after Christmas) I wanted a particular accessory for one of my hobbies. Now while she didn't exactly what I wanted, she at least tried. Now let's get to this past Christmas.\n\nIn order to avoid the previous Christmas' fiasco, I started sending Christmas lists to her on the regular. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc. There were plenty of highly detailed and specific gifts of varying price points. And since I started sending them to her in September, she had plenty of time to fit me in her schedule. \n\nNow since we share an Amazon account, I can see whenever she orders something. I knew she was getting me a particular tool off the list not only from the order confirmation but she asked me about it two days before that. I was feeling a little down that the surprise was ruined but I was getting a new tool. \n\nChristmas day rolls around and it's my turn to open gifts. New tool? Yup. Sweet. I'm thinking that's it because typically stockings are just decoration. But she had our two year old run mine to me. Inside was a map with instructions on where to find the next gift. So me and my son go on a scavenger hunt for all these little gifts scattered around the house. The last gift was a gift card for the accessory I had wanted the previous Christmas. She even said she got similar one at a local store but returned it when she did a little more research into it thinking that it was wrong. She asked me if the first one was correct and I told her either would have been fine. \n\nI teared up a little because she did a fantastic job of making me feel special and that she actually was willing to put in the time for me. She showed me that affection is not a one way street and she was willing to do the things that would make me happy. I'm still giddy about it becuase it was so much fun. \n\nTLDR; learn how your partner receives love and you'll both be happier.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1578971869, "gildings": {}, "id": "feceb12", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eob5yh", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_fec7h7b", "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/eob5yh/what_is_something_every_woman_should_know_about/feceb12/", "retrieved_on": 1578988699, "score": 251, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ITriedLightningTendr", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2i104q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "The love language book is a pretty good read for that.

that said, all brains are wired differently and thus require different amounts of mental energy or effort to take part in social interaction, or are more or less sensitive too it.\n\nPeople who are more sensitive to interaction or who require more mental effort to take part in it will often begin to feel drained from it, the same way long hours of menial tasks at an office cubicle may wear on others.\n\nI have two metaphors that I have found to be very well received when explaining to my students and friends:\n\n1. All people have skin, and Most people enjoy massages or gentle head rubs. But anyone would say that rubbing the exact same spot for 16 hours straight would make the skin feel raw and sensitive, possibly slightly painful. And there are some with very delicate skin who will reach that point after only an hour or two. It\u2019s not that they suddenly hate being massaged, it\u2019s just that the slight wear on the skin has gotten to a point where they need to take a break from getting rubbed.\n\n2. Everyone needs social interaction, but are sensitive to it on a wide variety of levels. Imagine a large barrel that can be filled with water; this will represent our \u201csocial interaction\u201d tank. This tank has a small leak in the bottom, so it must be occasionally topped up. But if you fill it up too much, it overflows and makes a mess everywhere and can be quite the pain to clean up. Many tanks have tops on them, with maybe just a few small holes through which rainwater can enter; this makes them less \u201csensitive\u201d to the rainwater. Other tanks may have giant holes or no top at all, so rainwater may flow freely into the barrel; making them far more sensitive to rainfall. 6 hours of rain may be a perfect amount to fill a tank with small holes, while the open tank may have started overflowing and making a mess after just 1 hour. It would be better if we could move the open barrel out of the rain after it fills up quickly, so as to avoid making a mess. It will still need to be topped off later as the water slowly leaks out, but RIGHT NOW more water is just making a mess and the barrel needs to be out of the rain for a while.\n\nYou may be your significant other\u2019s favorite \u201cwater\u201d, but too much is too much no matter where it comes from. Just as too much social interaction will make a brain that is more sensitive to it feel raw and sore, or overflowing and out of control.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1578963813, "edited": 1578964056.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "febxaji", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eob5yh", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_febsyrl", "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/eob5yh/what_is_something_every_woman_should_know_about/febxaji/", "retrieved_on": 1578981389, "score": 113, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "total_awards_received": 0}]}
