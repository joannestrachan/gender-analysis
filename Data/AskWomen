Every time a thread like this pops up \"not like other girls\" types chime in that they *can't* make female friends because the women they see \"wear makeup\" or \"do their hair\" or something equally surface level.\n\nMaybe in movies that's supposed to say a lot about someone, but in real life the fact that a girl I know does or doesn't wear makeup tells me practically *nothing* about whether or not I'd get along with them. *Of course* if you buy into every teen movie you've ever seen you think you're \"not like other girls\", those girls are portrayed horribly and exceptionally one dimensionally. Practically no one in real life, not even the Kardashians or Paris Hilton types, are that devoid of depth.\n\nIt's funny because usually they're coming at it from the angle of \"I'm not superficial and they are\", but *they're* the ones deciding who they will or won't be friends with based on their style. That's *wayyyyyyyyy* more superficial than slipping on some lipstick or curling your hair.And of course there's no real male equivalent for their guy friends. \"Oh he shaves his stubble daily, he's way too high maintenance we could never be friends\"\n\nSmart, capable, cool women style themselves in every single way imaginable. Michelle Obama is gorgeous, always wearing something stylish, does her makeup, etc. *And* has two ivy league degrees, among a laundry list of other accomplishments. Imagine avoiding her as a friend because she's \"too feminine\" or \"basic\" at first glance.\n\nI also hate the idea that comes along with all this, that you can only be successful friends with people who are *exactly like you.* That's so goddamn boring and not true. I'm 24 and have two friends in their 70s. I'm not very athletic and I have friends that might as well be olympic athletes. I have friends that are waaaaay less nerdy than me. We don't have everything in common but we all have chemistry, and I learn a lot from my friends that aren't the exact same \"type\" of girl or person as me.
