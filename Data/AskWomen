Every time a thread like this pops up \"not like other girls\" types chime in that they *can't* make female friends because the women they see \"wear makeup\" or \"do their hair\" or something equally surface level.\n\nMaybe in movies that's supposed to say a lot about someone, but in real life the fact that a girl I know does or doesn't wear makeup tells me practically *nothing* about whether or not I'd get along with them. *Of course* if you buy into every teen movie you've ever seen you think you're \"not like other girls\", those girls are portrayed horribly and exceptionally one dimensionally. Practically no one in real life, not even the Kardashians or Paris Hilton types, are that devoid of depth.\n\nIt's funny because usually they're coming at it from the angle of \"I'm not superficial and they are\", but *they're* the ones deciding who they will or won't be friends with based on their style. That's *wayyyyyyyyy* more superficial than slipping on some lipstick or curling your hair.And of course there's no real male equivalent for their guy friends. \"Oh he shaves his stubble daily, he's way too high maintenance we could never be friends\"\n\nSmart, capable, cool women style themselves in every single way imaginable. Michelle Obama is gorgeous, always wearing something stylish, does her makeup, etc. *And* has two ivy league degrees, among a laundry list of other accomplishments. Imagine avoiding her as a friend because she's \"too feminine\" or \"basic\" at first glance.\n\nI also hate the idea that comes along with all this, that you can only be successful friends with people who are *exactly like you.* That's so goddamn boring and not true. I'm 24 and have two friends in their 70s. I'm not very athletic and I have friends that might as well be olympic athletes. I have friends that are waaaaay less nerdy than me. We don't have everything in common but we all have chemistry, and I learn a lot from my friends that aren't the exact same \"type\" of girl or person as me.

I had found my sons parents through an adoption agency in my state, and it felt like it was meant to be. Any fear that I had about where my birth son would be had disappeared when I met them. I spent the whole pregnancy trying not to love the child inside me because I was trying to save myself from any more heartbreak. But how can you not fall in love with someone that is with you 24/7 for 9 months? \n\nWhen I was giving birth, I told the doctor and nurses to take my son out of the room before I could see him. I wanted his parents to have that special moment with him, to be the ones to bond with him from the very beginning. The time in the hospital felt like an out of body experience, I was so overwhelmed with emotions but was trying to keep myself in check. I cried a lot. The first few months after placing my son were the hardest. I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t shower, and I didn\u2019t get out of bed. But slowly, it got easier. I saw my birth son and his parents occasionally and those trips felt both exciting and depressing. Seeing the kindness and love that they radiated made my grief a little bit easier. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 5 years now, and there are still times that are hard. I find myself wondering if I will ever have another baby, because how could I deserve a child after placing one? Then, I see the life my birth son lives and it brings me joy. He has already gone to so many places and experienced things that I haven\u2019t and he\u2019s not even 5 yet. I feel grateful for his parents. I\u2019ll be honest though, I cried to my boyfriend last night about my son. (I am taking my boyfriend to meet my son tomorrow afternoon) I told him I was worried that he would want to leave me because he would actually see my son and see this whole other part of me and my life and decide that he couldn\u2019t be with someone who placed a baby. So, I still suffer from some issues when it comes to the adoption. But it has gotten better. I know there are always going to be dark moments and I realize I have said mostly those. But my sons adoption has also been beautiful and there have been good moments. Like birthdays, dinners, and holidays.

I used to enforce goals and routines and disciplines under the guise of self care.

Which is completely valid and is often the case. \n\nI'd just like to add a different perspective? \n\nI'd class my husband as high maintenance, he takes a lot of energy and time. He has ADHD and is unmedicated- it's a lot of work being his partner and support system. \nHe needs alot of attention, verbal affirmation of my feelings and physical touch, I mean almost daily. These aren't negatives, it's not his fragile masculine ego needing boosting. That's how he communicates during his hyper phases, during his times of hyper focus I could leave him for hours on end undisturbed, he wouldn't even notice if I was in the house! \nHe loses everything, is awful at planning, can be reckless with spending, he can never remember appointments, or the important thing I told him 20 mins ago. I have systems in place to help, and together we keep on track - its not easy, it takes work and some days it's exhausting. But its so worth it.\n \nFor all the effort and energy I put in I get the most wonderful man, he's unpredictable at times sure, but it keeps me on my toes. Life is never boring!

My girl friends made fun of me for dating him for all the reasons I loved him and so under so much peer pressure, I dumped him for being \"too clingy\".\n\nTwo months later my (ex) best friend decided she wanted to date him so they did and she suddenly dumped him after he spent the weekend at her house. Although I was very hurt she dated him despite me telling her I didnt want her to, she convinced me to remain friends. She claimed he tried to rape her. Considering I dated him for 10 months and he never once even tried to do something like that with me I was skeptical. \n\nShe continued her trash talking him so badly that he almost was charged (she backed out when she couldn't give a straight story) and he moved to the city 2 hours away to live with his aunt and uncle because school became too hostile and he did his courses via independent learning. Behind (ex) best friends back me and him kept in touch but barely but we have mutual friends and I see him occasionally. Fast forward three years and we are a week from graduation. I see him at school and we make plans to go on a date the next evening and are hoping to rekindle things over the summer since he's moved back to town. \n\nThat night, I get a phone call from our mutual friend, they are crying and tells me that he got into a car accident and didn't make it. He was trying to pass cars on a road under construction, no seatbelt, hits the gravel side of the road and flips his Jeep. He died instantly. \n\nI still think about him. He had invited me to the event he was speeding to. I could have been with him, he always drove slower and safer with me in the Jeep. I miss him so much and I still wonder if I would have ended up with him. \n\nMy husband knows all of this and is very sympathetic about it. Husband reminds me so much of him, maybe that's why I fell in love with him, I dunno.\n\nBut I still think of him, I still have the bracelet he gave me and every year on the anniversary of his accident and his birthday I think a little more of him.

My destination was a refuge with family and a chance to better our lives. Fast forward 12 months, the reality of our situation was dire, and I was forced to go back for my kid's sake.  We needed a roof over our heads and financial help, Semi-Ex helped relocate us back, the kids stayed with him, I lived with friends. Eventually this living situation eroded and I moved back in with them all. Nothing has changed really. The kids found ways to spend time with him, and I found work and school to help me. We morphed into a odd arrangement...no divorce, but now just two people who inhabit the same space on two opposing work schedules, who function as good roommates. Was this what I wanted? Absolutely not.  But along the way I learned a lot about life, friends, family...as did my kids, which may have helped us all in the long run.

(She's not a reddit user.)\n\nBefore I say anything, this definitely would not work for many women, especially those with significantly different personality types to my wife.\n\nFor her the main trick was agreeing to schedule sex in advance. She's a natural planner, a very scheduled person, and doesn't really like surprises. So when she found herself still experiencing a low libido a year after our second was born, we agreed to schedule sex for twice a week. For her it really worked. She knew to expect it, so she would mentally sort of organize her day knowing it was going to happen so that we weren't caught up with chores or whatever by the evening (I would do the same obviously). She would also make a point to think about all the things she liked about sex and give herself a chance to look forward to it in a way that would really help her get into the mood.\n\nOnce we actually got started, we would go slow and help her work herself into the mood even more, and things would usually go well.\n\nWhat I also learned from that though was that if I want to proposition her on a particular day, the best time to do it is earlier in the day. Giving her a chance to mentally get herself ready and in the mood increases her pleasure and excitement, and helps us make sure we're preemptively addressing anything that might distract or stress her out. It really helped us get back on track, and we don't stick to the schedule so much any more because we don't need to. Our libidos still don't perfectly match, but we're both in a happy place where she's having sex a little more often than her normal level of desire would really warrant, but still within her comfort zone, and I'm having a little less sex that I'd really be prefer, but I'm not serially sexually frustrated either. It's no longer me initiating all the time, and we're both in a better place for that part of our relationship.

When I'm regularly not feeling excited it's usually down to a confidence issue for myself, an underlying relationship issue with my partner that we haven't cleared the air on yet, or increased stress from work.\n\nFor confidence, working out regularly has been the biggest helper there. Even though my body doesn't look the way I want it to yet, I still get confidence and an increased sense of self worth from working hard towards my goals.\n\nFor the relationship issues, the biggest help for me has been practicing mindfulness and recognizing when that's the issue. I used to shove those feelings down and try to convince myself that I just wasn't in the mood. Now, I'm getting better at recognizing that I'm feeling negatively towards him for something and communicating about it to clear the air and prevent resentment.\n\nFinally, for work stress, that's been harder to tackle. Cardio has helped me a lot, running on the elliptical for 30-60 minutes with music blasting clears my mind and helps reduce my stress. I've also gotten better at recognizing when working a little more will make my whole evening better, sometimes if I just take another look at the work issue or get a couple emails out it alleviates the worry and allows me to put it away until the next day.

Hanging out becomes an obligation.\n\n-You need to be drunk and/or high to have fun with them, or all interactions involve alcohol or drugs.\n\n-Ad hominim attacks (\u201cyou\u2019re ______\u201d) or black-and-white thinking (\u201cyou always/never _____\u201d), even if you\u2019re not fighting\n\n-Negative comments about your body or appearance that are framed as being \u201csupportive\u201d or \u201cencouraging\u201d (\u201cyou\u2019d look better if you lost some weight,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re really broken-out today\u201d)\n\n-Control over activities: you never get to choose a restaurant, movie, event, or travel location.\n\n-Disregard for your time (getting stood up, random/unplanned communication blackouts, lateness, staring at their phone in silence during together time)\n\n-Disregard for personal hygeine and/or cleanliness\n\n-Disregard for safe sex or pestering you for certain sex acts or children\n\n-Disinterest in meeting your family or friends\n\n-Disinterest in your feelings, viewpoint, or perspective", "created_utc": 1563400162, "gilded": 1, "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "id": "eu2x6na", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cehb76", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_cehb76", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cehb76/what_are_some_signs_that_you_might_overlook_when/eu2x6na/", "retrieved_on": 1563400163, "score": 220, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563499565}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "6ofcrowns", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_239803h6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "When you honestly feel relief at getting alone time when they are leaving.", "created_utc": 1563399550, "gildings": {}, "id": "eu2w8sp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cehb76", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_cehb76", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cehb76/what_are_some_signs_that_you_might_overlook_when/eu2w8sp/", "retrieved_on": 1563399551, "score": 421, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563499343}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "lostbane", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2a4s3hnk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "when you find yourself complaining more about your partner than praising them to friends and family", "created_utc": 1563399052, "gildings": {}, "id": "eu2vhcx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cehb76", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_cehb76", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cehb76/what_are_some_signs_that_you_might_overlook_when/eu2vhcx/", "retrieved_on": 1563399053, "score": 315, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563499164}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "creativelyuncreative", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": "female", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8106c61a-c8aa-11e1-a771-12313b0ce1e2", "author_flair_text": "\u2640", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hibxk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "When you go through relationship threads on Reddit looking to see if anyone else feels the way you do.

I ignored these feelings when they popped up in my head of \"this isn't what I want, this isn't who I want to marry\" throughout my last relationship that lasted almost 2 years. I tried to share my doubts and be honest with my ex, who to his credit worked on himself and tried to do better. We moved in together because when things were good, I felt wonderful, but I couldn't shake the nagging thoughts of wanting to be with someone else (I didn't have a person in mind, I just wanted to date someone other than my ex). I thought my fear of commitment to him would quell after we moved in together. To no one's surprise but my own, it amplified my uncertainties instead. I finally ended the relationship for good because he is a great guy and he deserves to be with someone who is absolutely head over heels for him and treats him like he puts the stars in the sky. At my best, I was a good girlfriend, but I was mostly lukewarm in my emotions towards him, and I really hurt him for a while.

Like taking out the trash, or running to the grocery store, or changing out the toilet paper roll. Definitely say thank you for the big stuff and the stuff you couldn't have done yourself, at least as easily.\n* Apologize for inappropriate behavior - A lot of unstable couples fall into a routine where they just let these outbursts slide by without addressing them. They get comfortable in their wallowing, venting, etc. A healthy relationship means actively working to recognize where you may have been wrong/irrational and/or hurt the other and admitting your fault without waiting for them to bring it up.\n* Sacrifice - Relationships involve a certain amount of healthy sacrifice to remain in balance. Sure, you each should be your own person and you should do your best not to hold the other back from what they love or aspire towards, but a healthy relationship will continue to involve self-sacrifices that you choose to make for the betterment of the relationship or the other person. If you stop sacrificing and start counting every little loss as a personal defeat, you're being selfish and this leads to unhealthy problems and patterns.\n* Say I Love You (or share your common affections) - It's not true that a word loses meaning if it's said too often. You should express your verbal affections as often as they're felt. If you can no longer bring yourself to express these affections consistently (or worse yet, you don't feel them at all) then the flame is dying.\n* Compliment or Encourage one another - Along with the above, strive to remind your SO on a consistent basis of the things that you love about them. Compliment their looks, or brains, or cooking. Pinch their butt. All of that stuff that tells them that they are still active on your mind and of interest / importance to you. If this stops, the desire is also.\n* Make each other feel good - It's simple. If you're thinking about them lovingly, you will likely want to do things that make them feel good. Buy them their favorite candy bar when you're at the store. Rub their feet or back for no reason. Massage their scalp. (Try to) cook them a really nice dinner.

If I fancy a closer shave I shave sideways after but never go against.\n\nExfoliate again if im feelin fancy (but very lightly. I have no idea if this improves the results tho) and then PAT the area dry. \n\nI then moisturise with some thick E45 cream, let that sink in and then apply some plain Dove antiperspirant stick. The moisturising one. I know it sounds odd but good lord this stuff works.

They can also be degrading or violent towards the woman, which can really take us out of the groove. In lesbian porn, the focus is usually more romantic and female focused. Sex therapist Megan Fleming Ph.D says, \u201cIn lesbian porn, there really is a focus on oral sex and clitoral stimulation as the main event\u201d, which can be difficult to find in straight porn (unless you\u2019re looking on\u00a0Bellesa obviously).\n\nMany women also love lesbian porn because they are watching two familiar bodies.

Here's my comment on the overall thread, and I hope it's a tighter version of what you or others might need to hear right now:\n\nI have so much respect for women who feed themselves first before bestowing their gifts to others in need. Those are women who, to me, \"have their acts together.\"\n\nWomen are taught in so many ways to sacrifice their own needs, wants and desires in order to benefit others, often to their own detriment - - but you can't give what you don't have. Take care of yourself first, all you mothers, daughters, granddaughters, grandmothers, wives, girlfriends, sisters, aunts, nieces, friends, neighbours, acquaintances - you will be of no use or help to anyone else unless you love and take care of yourselves first and foremost &lt;3", "created_utc": 1562743320, "gildings": {}, "id": "eterb09", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cb7ywq", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_eteqgd7", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cb7ywq/what_makes_you_look_at_a_woman_and_think_that/eterb09/", "retrieved_on": 1562743321, "score": 131, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562835917}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "elmel1229", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zq998zw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "I would say that you are now an inspiration to a whole different set of women.", "created_utc": 1562742257, "gildings": {}, "id": "eteqgd7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cb7ywq", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_eten109", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cb7ywq/what_makes_you_look_at_a_woman_and_think_that/eteqgd7/", "retrieved_on": 1562742259, "score": 202, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562835727}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "thingsandstuffandstu", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ooyc71k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "I feel like this is the exact kind of comment that makes a lot of people feel 'lesser-than.' Well, it does me, anyway. \n\nI don't want to detract from anyone who is really feeling this woman's brilliance, but just in case you're reading this and thinking, \"Oh dear Lord. How could I ever compare...? - - \n\nI *used* to be that woman. I had all my shit together, after working so hard for a university scholarship, obtaining my dream job, and eventually finding someone who brought out \"the best in me.\" I came from nothing, and got myself to the top. I then worked hard to be the bastion of strength to all of the young women I knew. I became what I thought was \"the perfect version of me.\" I ended up being a mentor to a number of younger women in my mostly male-dominated career, and even though I knew they'd love me no matter what, I felt a great pressure to be the best I could be at all times, to make sure they knew they could do and be the same. I worked, I worked out, I read, I learned, I took classes, I took time for spirit, and most of all, I NEVER let anyone know how depressed I was throughout all of \"my successes.\"\n\nThe thing is... sometimes, being a \"Superwoman\" takes a lot out of you. Sometimes, when you're at the top being looked up to, you don't know where to turn when things fall apart. \n\nMy husband left me for a younger woman, after lying about it. I changed careers shortly after, and had to start from scratch. I can't begin to tell you how much I felt like a failure, having been previously a mentor for so many younger women in my life.\n\nI \"had it all,\" but then had to claw my way back after all of that fell apart. \n\nListen - if you need to hear it, things can fall apart even after \"you have your act together.\" You can still be brilliant when you have to rebuild. Don't set your sights on anyone else's achievements EVER. Know each and every single day that you're meeting your own expectations; that you're doing the best you can do with what you have, and cut yourself the slack that you cut everyone else in your life *who you love.* Love yourself.\n\nHaving your act together means you love yourself the way you love everyone else. Compare yourself to YOU and to no one else. You have no idea what others are going through. Love you first, and you'll be amazed and surprised with what you accomplish. It's great to think about how others have worked through their own shit, but honestly KNOW that they might have skeletons in their closet that you know NOTHING about.", "created_utc": 1562738432, "gildings": {"gid_1": 2}, "id": "eten109", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cb7ywq", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_etdy2e9", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cb7ywq/what_makes_you_look_at_a_woman_and_think_that/eten109/", "retrieved_on": 1562738433, "score": 632, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562834910}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "wgretzskymscott", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1rn33y0v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "\u201cI would never tell her to her face but she is a very gifted artist\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael, why WOULDN\u2019T you tell her that?!\u201d", "created_utc": 1562731509, "gildings": {}, "id": "etefto3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cb7ywq", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ete57we", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/cb7ywq/what_makes_you_look_at_a_woman_and_think_that/etefto3/", "retrieved_on": 1562731510, "score": 380, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562833249}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "issius", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "male", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": "\u2642", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5r2e3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Seriously, basic shit!
