Lately we started hanging out alone more and he\u2019s just amazing. Cute, smart and pretty shy but I like it. Not sure if he feels the same way about me but he always wants to hang out so I hope that\u2019s a good sign. I only have one problem....\n\nMy \u2018condition\u2019 (couldn\u2019t think of a more fitting word) is that I sneeze when I\u2019m aroused. Yes, really. Whenever I have a sexual thought or get turned on I get these sneezing fits. I use nasal sprays to keep things under control. \n\nAnyway, whenever I hang out with this guy I start sneezing as soon as I see him. At the beginning I told him that it\u2019s just a cold (it wasn\u2019t) and that I\u2019m very sensitive during cold seasons (I\u2019m not). I kept lying about it and he probably thought I\u2019m just a sickly person. For a while he even encouraged me to go to the doc but I told him that it\u2019s not a serious problem. \n\nThe problem is that he\u2019s slowly putting the pieces together but he\u2019s taking it the wrong way. He pointed out that I only sneeze when I\u2019m around him, not others. For example one time he saw me talk to a friend and I was fine, when I came up to him and we hugged I sneezed. He joked that I\u2019m obviously allergic to him and that I should just be honest if I can\u2019t stand him. \n\n\nSo should I tell him the truth or would it be too creepy? At this point we\u2019re pretty comfortable around each other but I don\u2019t wanna make things weird. Would it freak him out? \n\n**TL;DR I sneeze when I\u2019m physically aroused.

I called a cop to come stand outside while I got my things. He teared up a bit, and then asked why we couldn't talk about it. We have talked about it so many times. He told me it was embarrassing that I called the cops. When I was finished packing, I asked him for my spare car key and he said \"I don't have my keys with me. You didn't warn me you were calling the cops. If I'm allowed inside I can go get them.\" \\*Eye Roll.\\*  He truly did not understand why I called the cops. I never thought he would lay a hand on me, but I didn't want to risk anything. I was worried he'd try to keep me there to talk, or let the air out of my tires again.\n\nHe then told me he had been thinking about suicide. Maybe he said it to make me feel bad, but I told him to seek therapy because I want him to be happy and figure out his issues. He told me he listed out all of our issues and that it was less than 10 things. I'm not sure how that was supposed to make me feel better.\n\nI am back at my mom's and he is currently packing his things and going to Florida to visit his family. I have been in contact with his brother since I found out about the coke and he has been very supportive of my decision, along with my sister and a close friend of mine.\n\nThank you, redditors, for helping me taking the leap. I am extremely sad, but not regretful of my decision. I would've loved to work things out, but realistically it is just not possible. I cannot change the hurt he caused me. I cannot convince him to be honest with me or himself. I am ultimately enabling him to treat me like shit by staying in this marriage, and I will not accept that for him or myself.

Also, this is a throwaway account and I was an idiot when writing my name and typed throwaway instead of throwra.\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for 3 months now, so it's pretty new. So far everything is going well except this tiny little detail. He has this teddy bear, let's name him Teddy. Teddy has always been a part of my boyfriend's life : he got him for his birth and when at around the age of 5 or 6 (or whatever age is the appropriate age to remove a teddy bear from a child) his parents tried taking Teddy away from him, he screamt and cried so loud without stopping they ended up giving up. So he kept Teddy with him his whole life. \n\nHe mentionned Teddy to me pretty early, about a week after us being together. He showed me pictures of him and I found it cute at first. He had plenty of pictures of him in different situations (him with a mug, him laying in bed, him studying...). I truly found it adorable since I thought it was just a joke really and didn't think that Teddy was such a big part of his life. The more we got to know eachother the more he started mentionning him. He'd often make jokes about him. When he had to come back to his flat, he'd say \"I have to come back Teddy is waiting for me\" and then later he'd text me \"ok I put Teddy to bed so now I might go to sleep as well i don't want to wake him up\". Again, a little weird but cute still. But he really started talking about him constantly, always linking what we were doing to him (\"Oh I wish Teddy was with us to see that\", \"Teddy doesn't really like people so I won't take him with me for this party\" etc...) . He'd send me selfies with him at least twice a week.\n\nHe also sometimes said weird stuff like whenever we watched a sex scene in a movie he'd say \"that's what me and Teddy do when we're alone\" or when i asked when he lost his virginity he answered \"oh I lost it with Teddy a few years ago\". They were jokes that made me uncomfortable. He always seemt to consider him as a baby/his son/his brother, so him being sexualised was extremely weird for me. I told him then that it was weird and he just laughed but I don't think he took me seriously.\n\nAbout a month ago, I told him I was okay with him bringing Teddy when he was staying around my flat. I could see it was making him sad to leave him, and also was very curious to finally see him in person (I can't go to my boyfriend's flat, there are rules that are strict, he can't invite anyone). So that day I drove to his flat and he went with all his stuff and Teddy. When he got in the car he pulled him out from his bag and had him give me a kiss on the cheek. When we drove, he opened the window and put Teddy out of the car (a bit like a dog would). He said it was rare for Teddy to travel like that and he could feel that he was happy. Teddy smells a lot, my boyfriend hasn't washed him in 12 YEARS. For the rest of the car drive, he hugged him and gave him kisses.\n\nHe has weird \"twitch\" where he just compulsively pats the back of Teddy (it makes a weird sound because Teddy used to be able to play music when you pressed his belly). He always rubs Teddy's clothes inbetween his fingers (you can guess that Teddy is in a pretty bad state, he used to be red and now he's just grey). When we're together in bed, he always puts Teddy's mouth on my mouth and I always avoid it as I find it disgusting (and I told him that I hate it but he doesn't listen). He always tries to have Teddy touch my boobs or my arse. When we make love, I often end up finding him inbetween us and every time I throw him away my bf says \"oh no he likes to watch\" in a joking way. He often mentions us having a threesome with Teddy, him (Teddy) being great at licking, and them always doing kinky stuff together.\n\nNow I'm not an idiot. I know communication is important. I tried talking to him so many times. Sometimes in a joking way too so he doesn't feel attacked (like once, I asked who would he choose if he had to choose between me and Teddy, he said Teddy), but also so many times in a serious way (I told him I didn't like when he was rubbing Teddy on my face and body, I told him I found his relationship with him way too intense and weird) but every time he didn't take it seriously, made jokes, and never truly told me what he thought. I should mention that he is like that for any serious conversation, all he does is make awkward jokes and he never tells me how he feels (he said I love you first because he was drunk).\n\nThis is becoming hard to handle. I have been away from him for two weeks and was kind of relieved I wouldn't see Teddy anymore, but all he did was send pictures, and whenever I asked him \"what are you doing\" or \"what did you do today\" is answer was \"playing with Teddy\". Today he told me I was perfect, which was a first and I sure didn't expect that (he doesn't give a lot of compliment). When he said that I said \"really ?\" and his reply was \"actually no, Teddy is perfect, you come way after him\". I just gave up and didn't reply.\n\nI have 3 questions. 1) Am I overreacting, am I the one not being tolerant enough, am I some boring girlfriend who can't welcome some childishness in her couple ? 2) What should I do, should I let him live his life with Teddy, should I ask him to make a real choice, should I ask him to just stop the sexual jokes... Like, who am I to ask such things I don't know ? Is it my place to tell him to stop being so weird with his teddy bear ? And 3) How do I get him to finally talk to me and take me seriously ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR : my bf has a weird relationship with his teddy bear, he considers him as a baby/a son but still makes very sexual jokes about him, often involving me by having him touch my body and it's making uncomfortable, what can I do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [21F] boyfriend's [23M] relationship with his teddybear is making me uncomfortable", "total_awards_received": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejyfv1/my_21f_boyfriends_23m_relationship_with_his/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "moodytuxx79", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_47y7w1m8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578153286, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "edited": 1578168307, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy8zh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 96, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1578192645, "score": 177, "selftext": "My husband has 3 older sisters and 2 younger sisters, but they are all very close in age. He is the only guy. \n\nI\u2019ve always sensed his sisters don\u2019t like me, but they\u2019re very fake and passive aggressive about it. They\u2019ll act all nice when they\u2019re alone with me, but when they all come together they try to purposely exclude me and will go as far as either completely ignoring my husband when he\u2019s with me, or trying to pull him away from me at their family gatherings so that I am left alone. \n\nHis mom is a saint and is the only reason why I would still even consider showing up at any of their little get togethers, but after the one last night I doubt I ever will again. In short, they were all very rude the whole night, again being very passive aggressive and just straight up ignoring both my husband and I. I don\u2019t know why honestly. I\u2019m very shy so I\u2019ve never been super open with them or anything, but I\u2019ve always been polite to them and open to getting to know them. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve pretty much decided I want nothing to do with the sisters anymore. I know this hurts my husband because he\u2019s very family oriented and grew up close with a few of them, but I also know that if it comes down to it, if I say I want nothing do with them, he won\u2019t want to either because even he sees how rude they\u2019ve been to me on multiple occasions, for absolutely no reason. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just having trouble trying to figure out where to draw the line between no longer showing up to their family gatherings at all and trying to decide which ones are important for me to just stick out for the sake of my MIL since she is very dear to my husband and I. \n\nI\u2019m also currently pregnant, and I know my MIL and my mom are planning a \u201csurprise\u201d baby shower for me together. Obviously his sisters will be involved, but I\u2019m seriously reconsidering even having a baby shower because I don\u2019t want them to be apart of it, I do not want them there, and I do not want them to be apart of our baby\u2019s life. \n\nI know a lot of people will try to say im just hormonal and overreacting, because apparently that\u2019s the first thing everyone thinks as soon as someone even mentions being pregnant, but rest assured that i am being very vague here.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405340, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I want nothing to do with my husbands 5 sisters anymore", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "banned_by": "moderators", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578153168, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy854", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": true, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 187, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1578192588, "score": 171, "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Girlfriend attempted to cheat, got raped in the process, and now is looking to me for emotional support?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "Throwawayveeplalw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5azwkae5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578152711, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy4u9/update_i_told_my_ex_girlfriends_daughter_that_im/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy4u9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "/r/all", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": true, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 242, "num_crossposts": 1, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy4u9/update_i_told_my_ex_girlfriends_daughter_that_im/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1578192348, "score": 6835, "selftext": "Link to original thread - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/ega8eq/i_told_my_ex_girlfriends_daughter_that_im_not_her/\n\nCredit to /u/blackadar1 top comment, I sent that to my ex.

I never told the kids or ever let them see us fighting, as far as they knew we were happy, we just liked to pick on each other every now and again, at least that's how we made it seem in front of them. \n\nI have since moved on and am currently in a healthy and happy relationship with a man who goes out of his way to make sure my girls and I are happy. Earlier tonight my oldest messaged me on Facebook from their room to tell me that LT (my youngest) has been crying herself to sleep every night over this. I guess my oldest would calm her down and keep it secret because LT asked that but tonight was just too much. \n\nI went upstairs and LT was curled up pretending to be asleep but you could see the tears on her cheek. I told my oldest to leave the room so I could talk to LT. I asked her what was wrong and she said she missed her father, that she couldn't remember what he looked like. Side note: He doesn't see them that often, not because I keep them from him but because he lives an hour away and doesn't like to make the drive down here to see them. He can't have the kids at his house due to its condition. He was down this last weekend though due to the holidays and our oldest daughter's bday... I reminded her that she had just seen him over the weekend but she was still upset. She then asked why her father and I divorced. From day 1 I told her that while her dad and I still love each other, we agreed we are better friends than we are a couple. I did not go into details regarding the abuse or how he would neglect them to play on a computer etc. She didn't quite understand so I tried to put it in a way she would by using a friend of hers. They get along but they aren't best friends, same with her dad and I. She then asked about a song I used to sing to her 'You are my Sunshine' and asked if I would sing it to her. I pulled her into my lap and rocked her while I sang until she started to fall asleep then I put her in bed. \n\nMy question for everyone is, how can I help with this? She already sees a councilor, but I think she's hiding a lot of feelings. I lied a little to her, her dad and I aren't exactly friends. I do try to keep in touch with him as we agreed on shared parenting. I tried to call him so she could speak with him but he wouldn't answer. I just told her he must be sleeping (he's not, he works night shift so right now is his daytime) I spoke with my guy about it and he doesn't know what to do either. Should I arrange for him to spend some quality time with the girls or would that make it worse on her and make her miss her father more? I don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR- Youngest is upset that her father and I divorced a year ago and cries herself to sleep each night. Already seeing a therapist but I'm thinking she may be hiding feelings.

She said that the dealbreaker was her having a kid, and I said I wanted to have a biological child of my own so it might have to be. She changed almost instantly and started swearing, saying \"this isn't fucking happening\", \"What the fuck, do you know who I am? I don't give second chances.\", and said she would take our 2 cats and all of her belongings (which  I said yes to and threw her off as she was expecting me to fight that), then berated me for wanting to bring a child into the world when there are already so many and how dare I force a woman to go through childbirth. She said I might not even be able to have kids because of my low testosterone (which is true, but irrelevant and a **very** low blow), tried to tell me how expensive kids are (which I already know) then pivoted and said she was open to adoption/surrogacy/fostering despite what she'd just said and her consistency the past 2 years in not wanting kids (and just a few minutes before she'd said that our parenting styles with the cats were so different that having a kid would probably tear us apart). \n\nAll of this ended with her saying that if I truly loved her I would fix this, and that I wasn't breaking up with her and she'd be back Sunday to \"discuss this further.\" before walking out and saying that she couldn't believe I'd brought this up and that she'd been looking forward to one of the long goodnight texts I used to send before we lived together.\n\nSo. I feel like I **probably** made the correct decision, given some of the things she said and how she reacted/twisted things. She also tried to make me out as a bad person by saying \"How dare you say that I either have to have your baby or break up with you.\" Which... I guess if you want to twist things around to make me look bad that's the way to do it. I didn't **want** to break up with her, but given her positions and my wants I don't see another way around it. I tried to be as cordial and calm as I could be the whole time. I had to ask her to stop firmly when she went into the low testosterone issue, but aside from that I mostly stuck to apologizing and trying to deal with her changing her stance/position every few minutes.\n\nHere's my questions this time:\n\n1. I've been in an abusive relationship before, and the phrase \"If you truly love me you'll fix this.\" sounds dangerously close to some of the things my ex used to say. Is that actually as abusive as I feel it is, or am I letting my past experiences color my perception of this interaction too much?\n2. I've basically made up my mind, especially with how she treated me and some of the things she said today. Yes, I know I hurt her (and dear god did I feel horrible about that), but she basically spent the better part of an hour berating me for wanting to have a child and tried very hard to spin me as a bad person/make me feel bad. That alone is enough in my books to merit the end of our relationship. That being said, I could use some advice on how to handle the \"continuation\" of this conversation come Sunday. I know she's going to go home and research the cost of a kid, the cost of adoption/fostering/surrogacy, etc to try and throw in my face to argue me into agreeing with her.\n\nThanks again for all the advice from last time. I appreciated it, and I honestly do feel like I made the right choice.

Our marriage has some minor issues, but more like \"slowly dying\" issues and not domestic violence issues. I've never posted here before and never thought something like this would happen to me. This incident occurred on New Year's Eve. \n\nWe were drinking and having a good time playing some card games and waiting for midnight with a group of friends. One of the guys made an off-color joke about domestic violence, to which one of the girls got (rightfully) offended because she had been a victim of DV in the past. He didn't mean anything by it and apologized, and we seemed to be moving on.\n\nSuddenly my wife blurts out: \"Jim slapped me once\". I looked at her expecting to hear some kind of joke, but she had a serious look on her face. Everyone was kind of puzzled, but then she told this story about how when we were first married that we got into a big fight and I supposedly lost my temper and slapped her in the face.\n\nThis never happened. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a violent person. I've never hit anyone. I've never even been in a fight in school. I'm the youngest and smallest of four brothers and would routinely get my ass kicked by them, so reacting violently to situations was never my thing. I've never even raised my voice at my wife, which is something she's always hated about me because she feels like I don't show emotion.\n\nMy friends (male and female) immediately jumped to my defense and said they didn't believe her. Even her own best friend who's known me as long as we've been married didn't seem to believe her.\n\nAt this point my wife gets upset at the fact that no one believes her and starts to cry. She then starts trying to justify the situation and said that she was the one who was hitting me first and that I responded by slapping her back. The first part is true as she did attack me physically several times  in the early years, but I thought we worked through that and nothing like it has happened in a long time. However, again, I NEVER struck her back.\n\nOne of our friends started talking about false memories and how sometimes we remember things differently as a kind of way to change the conversation. Naturally the party took a weird turn after that and everyone left right after midnight.\n\nThings between my wife and I have been tense. I tried to sit her down and talk to her about it, but she still insists that it happened and that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nThis is the first and only time she's made an accusation like this, and of course she does it in front of other people, including an actual DV victim. How should I approach this? Is it even possible to help her realize that it never happened? Is this a sign of something deeper, like maybe her setting herself up for divorce? I don't think she's the type, but before the other day I didn't think she would be the type to accuse me of this bullshit either.\n\nObviously, I'm deeply offended by this and expect an apology, but I can't even move on to that side of things as long as she keeps insisting it happened.

Fairly big company with a large office. I enjoy my work and get along with everyone there. There are a few older, more experienced people who are team leaders and managers but most of us are young/under 30s. Out of us babies it's about 70/30 girls to guys. I generally hang out with the guys more. I don't dislike the girls but we don't have much in common (they're all graduates from top ranked places which I'm not. They're all very girly and pretty which I'm not etc.). I get along with them well enough though and have them all on social media. \n\nThere's this one guy in the office who barely speaks to anyone. I'll call him Mark. He's actually quite a friendly guy (and not bad looking either!) but is very quiet. He works hard and actually stays in the office when we all go for lunch. Pretty much all of the younger set make fun of him except me (and I do tell the guys to chill out with it), but the managers really like him because of how dedicated he is. \n\nWe were back at work yesterday, and Mark stepped out for something. One of my colleagues, Amanda, sneaked over to his desk for some reason. She looked into his computer, laughed and took a pic. \n\nI follow her on instagram and she put on her story a picture of Mark's google searches. It included things like ''How to get a girlfriend'', ''Places to meet women'', ''How to talk to women'', ''Places to meet new friends'', etc. Amanda wrote ''Imagine working with people like this #30yearoldvirgin.'' I felt really bad for Mark since he isn't a bad guy at all. \n\nWhen he came back I showed him the story and told him we should report her. We did. We spoke to the manager and she said she would deal with it. She called Amanda into the office. Don't know what she said but when Amanda stepped out she was close to tears. She sat down and got on with her work. \n\nIn the evening I was at home when I started getting DMs from some of the other girls in the office, calling me a ''snitch'' and saying they would ''ruin me'' if anything Amanda gets any kind of serious punishment (which I don't think she will). \n\nI'm worried about this situation. While I don't think anything will happen to Amanda, it won't be a fun place to work with her and her friends there.

Next dinner would be her treat, etc.\n\nHowever, about a year into the relationship, she was laid off from her job, so I picked up the slack and started paying for about 90% of our outings.  This went on for several months.\n\nFinally, she found a (rather high paying) job and has been gainfully employed for about 4 months now, making more money than I do.  However, whenever we go out, she gets alligator arms when the bill comes, and I sheepishly end up just paying it.  Instead of going back to sharing expenses like it was when we first dated, it was now \"assumed\" I would pay for everything.\n\nI've communicated to her about this and she agreed to start contributing.  I said I don't mind paying, but if I'm expected to pay for everything, its severely going to limit how often we are able to go out.  Otherwise, if she wants to go out as often as she does, I expect her to foot the bill sometimes.  She agreed....or so I thought.\n\nFast forward to NYE planning....I don't like going out.  Its crowded, overpriced, etc.  Not my scene.  However, she wants to go to a fancy restaurant with a couple of her friends (another couple).  I agree to go out, but ask that she at least split the bill with me.  She says Yes.\n\nThe dinner goes great and the bill comes.  She hesitates waiting for me to reach for the bill, but I don't.  Instead, I put cash on the table for my half (plus tip).  She gives me the stink eye, and angrily digs in her purse for her credit card.  The rest of NYE was spent with her sulking and ignoring me.\n\nThe following day, we are semi-fighting/re-hashing what happened the night prior, with it culminating in her texting \"Why the FUCK am I going dutch with my boyfriend of 2 years?\"\n\nI've admittedly been out of the dating scene for awhile, after being married for 15 years prior...is it still the expectation that the man pay for everything?  I had (maybe incorrectly) assumed the dating scene was more equal these days.  I feel taken advantage of when I am expected to foot the bill every time....like I'm viewed as a walking ATM.  How can I get her to understand my point of view?  I've spoken with her several times and it seems to go well....until the bill comes and she changes her tune.  \n\nTL;DR:  I (40M) helped to financially support my GF (42F) during her unemployment...paying for every night out.

But before that, let me say I\u2019m moving on now as a single parent and super happy with my decision to let go of this person! \n\nUpdate as of January 2020: Fianc\u00e9 is now my husband, but we only got married before I gave birth because in my country, an illegitimate child does not have full rights to own inherited property (sad, but true). We are only married legally but that\u2019s just about it. At least he agreed to this for our child.\n\n- Our child is now 6 months old and I am raising her with my family. \n- Since our child was born, he only saw her once, when she was 2 weeks old. I did not allow any more visits. Why? He\u2019s still toxic to be with. When he went to see our child, he even asked me to pay for his overnight hotel stay since he wanted to come with me on our baby\u2019s checkup the following day. Being the enabler that I am, I gave in and paid for it (now I know better). There was zero remorse, no \u201cthank you\u201d for single-handedly handling everything to the best I can, and I only received a list of grudges and another list of things he did right for me. I. Was. Just. So. Shocked witnessing how the person I loved turn into someone I barely know.\n- He is still in a relationship with the other party, but occasionally emails me that he regrets what he\u2019s done and wants to go back. I really don\u2019t get the point of this.\n- According to his sister, his new gf and her family are totally financially dependent on him and this is taking a toll on him. So his parents bought him a plane ticket back to his home country and he\u2019s living with them now because he can barely survive in our country having to support his new gf\u2019s family (their child together, the gf\u2019s child, gf\u2019s siblings, and grandmother). He just sends monthly support to his child with her.\n- I am soooo happy I\u2019m out of this relationship. At first I thought I couldn\u2019t handle the abandonment, but with time, I am even more thankful that my child and I were saved from being hooked further into this kind of man who is not even worthy of being called a father. \n\nThank you so much for all the support and your messages. These helped me gain perspective and be more firm at a time when I was so vulnerable. Given the circumstances around my pregnancy, I knew in my heart no amount of pain, betrayal or disrespect could stop me from being a mother. It\u2019s awesome to be a parent when you\u2019re so ready to have a child :)\n\nTL;DR: Fianc\u00e9 left me when I was 4 weeks pregnant with our first child. Turns out, he got another girl pregnant and our baby is only 5 days older than theirs. They lived in our conjugal home while I was away for a short work trip. I shared my story on Reddit 7 mos ago, thinking I couldn\u2019t handle this. But 7 mos on, I\u2019m continuing my journey as a solo parent and haven\u2019t looked back.

They were all home for Christmas and after conversations with my older two children, I have concerns about my youngest (\"Mary\"). Mary is in her second year of University, which is located about 90 minutes away from our house. She lived on campus her first year and is now renting a house with friends off-campus. \n\nIt started when my oldest made an offhand comment when Mary arrived home for her Christmas break to the effect of \"at least I won't be getting drunk snaps at 3 a.m. for a few weeks...\" I'm not up on snapchat, so later I asked her what she meant and she told me that Mary had been doing a lot of partying this semester and she had a habit of sending messages when she'd been out. Her and Mary are pretty close, so I pried a bit further and she told me that Mary was probably going out 3-4 times per week or more, and that she had also done some recreational drugs too - pot (which is legal here) and, she thought, cocaine (which is not, obviously). I asked if she did these things when she was that age and she said she wasn't cool enough to get invited to those kinds of parties (and I believe her - a mother knows her kids, okay!). \n\nMy son is at the same University but in his last year. I asked him offhand whether he saw that Mary went out a lot or anything and he more or less reacted as though he thought I already knew. He thought she went out most nights and that he thought she needed to watch her drinking because it could get her in dangerous spots. \n\nThis new information has changed my thoughts on a few things I'd noticed already. First, the grades that Mary has so far from her first semester are down a fair bit from her first year. She's still waiting on two exam results. Mary had said that the courses were just harder in second year, which I had thought reasonable at the time. Second, she had stayed at school over thanksgiving to work on a 'project', which I had thought a bit odd at the time but decided not to press. Third, she was around for New Years and while she was mostly off with her own friends in the basement, I did notice that she drank a lot that night.\n\nNow, Mary is an adult, and my husband and I have always tried to give our children their own autonomy and responsibilities. I was a pretty straight-laced kid, as was my husband, so I don't have perspective on what is 'normal' teenager rebellion/college fun or more serious. At the same time, I find this behaviour concerning, she's still young, and I'm still her mom. So, on the continuum from 1) a generic conversation about the risks of drugs/alcohol to 2) threatening to pull her tuition funding if she doesn't cut down on the partying and get those grades up, what do you feel is an appropriate response?  \n\nI do not want to inappropriately insert myself into her life, but at the same time I am concerned for her safety and future.", "send_replies": true,

with anyone but my husband. We had an arranged marriage and I am perfectly happy with it.\n\nFrom a young age, I had high hopes about my man. I wanted a well educated, physically and mentally sound teetotaler with a good job and nice family. And yes, he should love and respect me. If I had met anyone like that, I might have fallen in love. I didn't want to spend my time and efforts on clueless teenagers or jobless young men. I didn't want to play trial and error with my life and I am happy that I didn't have to, at least till now.\n\nWe found the person of our dreams through arranged marriage and there aren't any compatibility issues since our families did thorough background and character enquires before marriage. \n\n*These friends of mine thinks that I missed out so much 'fun'. I don't regret spending my time on some worthless men*\n\n* They hate that my MIL lives with us for half of the year\n\nI use the term MIL so that the readers will understand things clearly. I use the same term to address both my mother and mother in law(Amma). I think my husband's mother is my mother as well(keep your stupid incest jokes to yourself). She too thinks that both her daughters in law are her own daughters, except that we entered her life quite late. She had always wanted to have a daughter and when her son's got married, she was really thrilled. She is more like my best friend or partner in crime than an authority figure.\n\nShe divides her time between her two sons and both of us are happy to have her with us. She is a very friendly and kind woman. When she is with us, she helps us with the household tasks and looks after our 18m daughter. When I am too tired, she manages everything alone. I feel guilty but she tells that she could pursue a career only because her mil looked after her children and it is her duty to support her daughters in law.\n\nAlso, we often have 'girls' nights'. I am a bit of an extrovert but my husband likes spending time alone at home. On some days, I, my daughter and mil go out, and enjoy while husband chills at home. \n\n*My friends think that she is taking away what should have been dates between me and my husband. None of us thinks so*.\n\n* Our daughter is quite fond of her. I don't feel jealous that she likes her grandmother, sometimes even more than me. Grandma is more fun, knows many stories, plays with her often and spends more time with her.\n\nAlso, we make our daughter sleep on our bed, between me and my husband, like most Indian kids do. Though my friends tried to scare me with SIDS statistics, I didn't budge. Most if not &gt;90% children in Asia and Africa sleep like this and end up as perfectly normal adults. When mil is here, she takes the baby to her room sometimes so that we can get some 'private time' easily (an unspoken arrangement,of course) . \n\nI don't think she is stealing the affection of my daughter or that I need to establish some 'boundaries'. Even I used to like my grandparents more than my parents when I was young. That doesn't mean that I 'unloved' or disrespected my parents. I don't think that I need to be the centre of my daughter's existence. \n\n* Once, when my friends asked my husband whose cooking he likes the best, he replied that he likes his mother's cooking. Even I like her cooking which is far, far better than mine. I don't feel insulted or belittled. But they were like 'He shouldn't have disrespected you like that'. Wtf?\n\nBasically they think that I and my husband should be a team, 'we' and everyone should be some outsiders, they. But I consider my family (immediate and extended) 'we'. It is not as if we are some petty nuclear family teams fighting against each other. We are a big family and everyone likes and respects each other. \n\nMost of them have toxic mothers or mils. These intolerable insecure women also think that everyone except their husbands and children are some monsters who are out there to steal their 'family' from them. All my family has always been good to me. And my family includes my in-laws too. It is not a bubble. \n\nTl; Dr: How can I convince my acquaintances that I have a perfectly good family life? Or, how can I tell them to fuck off without coming off as too offensive?\n\nUpdates\n\n**Why do I hang out with these women if I have a happy life?** and different variations of it\n\nI am used to being friends with my neighbors. In India, we were like family, almost. I knew every Tom, Dick and Harry in my neighborhood. My father was friends(including his bf) with the people who used to commute with him in the train. \n\nAlso, I am used to being a part of different social groups. I don't have to drop one to join other.\n\n**How do these acquaintances know so much about me?**\n\nIt is my fault. Since I am not used to having too much privacy(as I said earlier, I knew a great deal of things about my neighbours and vice versa), I didn't care.\n\n**Why did I call them 'intolerable insecure women'?**\n\nThey are intolerable. They have told me that they are insecure. And they are women.\n\n**If I had an arranged marriage, could I go without changing my name?**\n\nYes. My grandmother, mother and mother in law have kept their maiden names. So did most of the working women I know. In my family, my grandmother's mil was upset, but things changed. We are from a fairly progressive area in Kerala, so we are able to live according to our convictions. \n\n\n**Am I materialistic? Why don't I like 'jobless' young men'?**\n\nI am materialistic because I am not interested in suffering. While I am aware that we often end up suffering due to unforeseen consequences of our actions, i didn't want to make choices which are very likely to cause suffering, especially since better alternative are  available. \n\n\n**Who takes care of my parents?**\n\nMy brothers. They visit me occasionally.\n\n**Won't grandma get bored?**\n\nShe is a trained classical dancer and singer. She pursues her interests when she gets time. And sometimes, we get free live entertainment.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2402326, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How can I(30f) convince my acquaintances(who thinks that they are my friends) that I am not an innocent, manipulated, gaslit victim?

If I died everything would be better.\n\nWhile all this was happening she went to dinner with her friend last night and her friend, i've heard them helping to fuck over one of their friends partners. She came home acting normal and told me to go play poker with her friends partner, i hadn't played for years but thought okay, it's sons birthday though, she said he's asleep it doesn't matter. Later i heard her on the phone saying i'm going gambling and it was son's birthday. I was like, man you told me too. She goes \"no, it's okay i'm joking\"\n\nI get home she seemed angry, next morning got up and made pancakes for nieces and kids and wife, she got angry saying i was selfish and how dare I make pancakes so early( but kids were already awake). About 20 minutes later I hear noises in the laundry, opened it and she was having a full on breakdown punching herself in the head and screaming, yelling at the kids and me, i was trying to calm her then she started attacking me, hitting me and I kept telling her to stop then she grabbed my hand and went to bite my hand and for some reason this time for the first time i reflexed and slapped her face, it wasn't hard, if i had hit that hard on the butt it wouldn't have hurt. It happened though.\n\nI apologised and said I shouldn't have done that but I really asked you to stop hitting me, you actually hit pretty hard. She goes your fucked cunt, i've got you now, see you in court, i'm going to take everything and your never going to see your kids again, i've sent a photo of this to my friend and your fucked. It feels like this was what she was trying to set up, and thinking about all the things she was saying, they found a way to fuck me without killing me. The red mark was gone from her face within an hour.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. She has taken the kids now and said i'll have to see them in court and that she wants the house (my house, i paid for 200k and 80% of mortgage for 10 years) this is then kids home, i don't want them with her alone but can't change it, she acts insane and yells, hits and screams at them, the kids think it's their fault so defend her, the only reasons the kids aren't fucked up now is the amount of time I spend with them i think. Her idea of quality time is to make the kids watch tv and yell at them if they talk while she's on her phone.\n\nWtf do I even do? \n\nExtra info.\n\nAge is 38 in Queensland, Australia\nWife is 37, have been togethor 19 years.\n\nShe has been spending all our money and hoarding shit for the last few years which has created pressure, with me riding her to stop buying shit she doesn't need, it started to escalate after I said I was getting rid of her credit card as she's racked up 40k in last 2 years on top of what i've paid off.\n\nIn the past she's admitted fault when she's gone too far and hit kids or something, she promised we'd do counselling as she has been on these antidepressants for 5 years she got from GP, and has never had a consultation and seems to be going insane.\n\nHelp", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2400954, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need help: think wife is trying to fuck me and I fucked up.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eja1wu/need_help_think_wife_is_trying_to_fuck_me_and_i/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "yeehaw_colleen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4747gnw1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578021256, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "edited": 1578023163, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ej9a9y/my_14f_mother_42f_refuses_to_let_me_shave_or_use/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ej9a9y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 606, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ej9a9y/my_14f_mother_42f_refuses_to_let_me_shave_or_use/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1578101506, "score": 899, "selftext": "Basically what the title says.\n\nI keep repeatedly telling her it's my body, so I should be allowed to make my own decisions, yet she keeps denying me saying, \"Trust me, I'm older and I know what's best for you\".

I was 15 when this happened and it tore their 25 year marriage apart. It ended in an awful divorce &amp; my sisters and mom left my dad immediately. We moved into a small 2 bedroom apartment , where my father lived in our 7 bedroom home. My mom became quickly depressed and drank relentlessly every night. As  I am the oldest , this meant picking up the slack around the house. I cooked , cleaned , bathed my sisters , took care of repairs and grocery lists meanwhile starting my sophomore year of High school and playing sports. I had enough of my moms drinking after a random man found my moms phone and called me to drive to pick her up 40 minutes away at 1 in the morning because she was too drunk to drive. I was unlicensed and had just received my drivers permit. I somehow got her home safely ( through LA freeways) and she vomited all over the car and on herself... the next morning she kicked me out of the house because I told her how unsafe that was and to slow down on drinking. She thought I was on my \u201cdads side\u201d. \n\nFlash forward to now, my parents managed to Co parent but eventually they started to date again. Calling eachother babe and going out on dates and traveling. My dad told me secretly in 2017 that the mistress he was with had moved away to Louisiana ( we live in California) and that he will never see her again. \n\nThat was a lie. \n2 months ago , I was house sitting for my dads house ( while my dad was on vacation with my mom) when I heard a ring in his room. I was the only one there so I went to check on the noise. My dad had just upgraded his phone for a newer model , but his iCloud was still connected to his old phone and did not realize every text he sent and received also went onto his old one. I checked who the message was from and low and behold , it was the Same Chick from 2015. She was sending him erotic text messages and pictures , saying he should of \u201c picked her , the love of his life, over his family \u201c and even sent him pictures of the son she recently gave birth too saying \u201c he looks just like you\u201d. The one thing that got me the most was when my father sent her the personal letter I wrote to him for his birthday and she said \u201c aww my future step daughter is so sweet. I know she\u2019ll love her new mommy just as much!\u201dI immediately took pictures of the conversation &amp; I have screenshots of them. I am planning on telling my mom , but this will wreck her.

This woman happens to have a young boy with a man who is not father of the year material to say the least. Someone who abused her and isn\u2019t nearly as supportive to the child as she is. As far as our relationship, things had been going pretty smoothly honestly. No real hiccups, we\u2019ve been seeing each other for almost a month now, and it\u2019s been comfortable. And in the meantime, I\u2019ve been trying to help her out and let her know that I would never abuse her and that I want to treat her right. That is until tonight on the phone.\n\nAs she was stressed from her kid aggravating her all day, I could tell she was getting flustered. She moved into the other room and she mentioned how stressed she was (this being the fourth or fifth time I\u2019ve noticed and probably the third time she\u2019s mentioned). I told her \u201cit\u2019s okay babe I\u2019m here for you. It\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d and that\u2019s when she snapped back with \u201cNo it\u2019s not okay you don\u2019t fucking understand. And I don\u2019t care how long we\u2019re together, you\u2019ll never understand or be that boy\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nNow on one hand, she\u2019s right but on the other hand, I\u2019m sacrificing a lot and putting a ton of effort into this relationship and trying to be the father that her kid deserves. And when I heard that, it truly stung me and it hurt. She never apologized, we just kinda sat in silence for 20 minutes or so as she attended to her kid, eventually asking \u201cyou still here babe?\u201d\n\nAm I overreacting? Would appreciate some outside opinions on it because it did sting to hear something like that when I\u2019ve been so supportive and helpful for her.\n\nEDIT: Couple of things. First of all, supporting someone and seeing value in someone does not make me a doormat or weak. Secondly, the term father was used loosely. I\u2019m not a father in the sense that I work a 9-5, come home and eat dinner, play with the child and fall asleep and do it all over again the next day. I simply meant as a male figure who is supportive and there for him in a way others have not been.\n\nThird, we met the child early because the child takes a while to adjust (and understandably so) and this is my second relationship so I\u2019m not sure what to do or what I should\u2019ve looked out for. Fourth, I appreciate all of the good advice.

Our family\u2019s were close as well. Last year we decided to date and we broke up due to wrong timing for the both of us. This year we decided to try again. \n\nI have been very good at protecting my energy and really careful on who I catch feelings for. And she\u2019s a girl that I genuinely loved and cared about. Still do. But with her I felt a connection that I haven\u2019t had with no one else ever in my life, probably due to all the history her and I have. So I decided to follow my heart and chase her. \n\nWe had been talking for months before we made things official. We were basically in a relationship without the title. She said she was committed and so was I, things were perfect. \n\nOn New Years she came over to my apartment and spent the night with me, we had sex and decided it was time to make things official and put that title on it. But today she told me she slept with someone else two days before we did that. \n\nThe dude that she slept with is an ex type figure, but not really. He was just a fuckboy that viewed her as a sex object, and she even knew that. But she has an \u201cemotional attachment\u201d towards him. I was aware of him the entire time her and I were talking and she told me they don\u2019t talk and she\u2019s focused on me. \n\nA week before they slept together, I even mentioned something about it bothering me she still has him added as a friend on Snapchat, and she said she\u2019ll remove him. But she didn\u2019t. It was a lie. \n\nShe told me she asked all her friends if she\u2019s a shitty person for sleeping with someone else when her and I had a thing going on. They said no because technically she was \u201csingle\u201d when she did it. Which yes we were technically single but at the same time, we weren\u2019t. \n\nShe wanted me to stay loyal to her and to act as if we were in a relationship and she\u2019d do the same.

I've started having more difficulty with depression and being unproductive and feeling bad about myself around him. Since he left for vacation with his family, I've started feeling much better and regaining my sense of self worth and how to be productive and happy again. I don't like alcohol so I haven't spiraled in that sense but I can relate to the temptation to cheat, because I can relate to not getting my needs met from him, however I am not going to and would never cheat on him. Instead, I've been trying so hard to get him to be kinder to me, less critical, and more empathetic, and to work on his relationship communication skills.

He\u2019s army, so he goes away for weeks at a time, which sucks for our boy but it happens. Where the issue lies is that my ex never calls our son between visits, which isn\u2019t too bad. But whenever he misses visits (for whatever reason) he also still does not call between. He also does not initiate contact when he is back from trips away, I have to make contact to ask when he will see our son. \n\nWhere we are now is that he left mid September, for 3 consecutive training/exercises and was due to be back at the end of October. For the last month, he was simply at the barracks in our city - but again never called at any point in this period, missing our sons 5th birthday. \nI didn\u2019t hear from him 2 weeks after he was due back, so messaged his mother asking if she\u2019d heard from him as our son missed him (he previously ignored my texts). \nShe never responded but the next day he did saying he was back, but was working the next two weekends. \n\nThat was 4 weeks ago, and he\u2019s not asked once to see our son, now missing Christmas as well. This breaks my heart because our 5yo has developed what seems to be separation anxiety and cries at night asking for his dad and looking at photos of him in the album I made for him as a baby.\n\nI ended up messaging him on New Years asking if he planned on seeing our son, did he want to adjust the arrangements to see him more or less frequently, or was he now wanting no contact at all. I explained I wouldn\u2019t judge either way, I just wanted to be able to tell our son something other than \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when he asks where dad is or when he\u2019s seeing him. \nWell it\u2019s been 2 days and still no answer. \n\nThe advice I\u2019m after is this - what on Earth do I tell my son? I don\u2019t want to say \u201cdads not como back.\u201d Because what if he shapes up and wants to see him, or god forbid he was in hospital or something and that\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t answered (which I know is unlikely). But I also can\u2019t keep stringing along my kid because he\u2019s absolutely aware of what\u2019s happening. I reassure him every day that me and his step dad love him, and that daddy loves him too - but I just feel like the poor kid is in limbo. However I do not want to bad mouth his father to him or make his father seem out to be a villain. He can make any conclusions as he grows up, but I also don\u2019t want him putting faith in someone so flaky. \n\nAny advice appreciated.\n\nTLDR: ex has always been a rather distant parent. Split up and now rarely sees our son. Hasn\u2019t answered any messages about when he will see him or whether or not he wants contact at all.

It will be official in 6 months. I felt like a weight was taken off my shoulders that I had been dragging. She was very slow to do her end of papers and it was a very painstaking process to get here. I was so relieved and happy that it got done today. It took effort and a lot of initiative on my part.\n\nI felt a lot of different emotions besides just relief. I reflected on what our marriage was and how we are now. We barely talk. I have only seen her in person maybe 5 times since she moved out (just for paperwork stuff). I will admit that I felt curiosity about what she is up to etc. We had blocked each other on social media months ago so I didn't know what was going on. I gave in to temptation and made a fake profile and stalked her instagram. This was a terrible idea. It turns out she has a boyfriend and they have been going out since at least 3 weeks after she moved out. On the one hand, it makes a lot of sense and in some ways that is validating (mostly that she is trash). But on the other, I didn't feel good about it because she moved on so quick. Overall, it messed up my night pretty bad and I haven't been productive in school because of it. \n\nAfter reflecting on the outcomes from my own actions tonight, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I pretty much suspected that was what I was going to find. (Turns out your gut knows more that you do) So why did I need to look? It wasn't necessary. \n\nI just wanted to share this for those who are thinking about looking back at relationships. Don't do it. Truthfully, you probably already know what you are going to find. Its not worth it. Instead, look forward to a better future.

Ex and I have always got on well and have shared little ill feelings since the separation, it was just something we both knew needed to happen and I get to see my daughter 3-4 times a week most weeks.\n\nAll of this happy family picture was shattered last Monday when my ex borrowed a USB stick that was plugged into my daughter's laptop to use to print a file and discovered that the drive contained 1000s of images of child porn of young boys, guessing 10-12,13 in sexual positions, naked etc. just vile imagery and she immediately called me to come over and talk about it.\n\nWhat is terrifying to me is that while much of it she seems to have downloaded off somewhere, there was some of it that was obviously self-created. Folders with boy's names, ages and text files with them of her 'backstory' or fake persona she used when talking to these teens. After a day of going through her laptop after making her unlock it for us we discovered she has been using falsehoods and numerous accounts on discord, snapchat and reddit to court 10s, 100s of boys aged in there tweens and early teens over a 2 year period into sending her sexually charged imagery. Reading through some of the messages, this is seriously fucking sick, vile, sociopathic stuff. Being friendly and nice, pretending to want a relationship with them in order to get them to send nudes and the like and then quickly ghosting each kid and moving on to the next victim.\n\nWe confronted our daughter about this and she laid it all on never having had a real relationship, hidden depression and desperately wanting to be male and to relive her teenage years as male (she has never mentioned the possibility of being trans before to us).\n\nHonestly, I'm just disgusted, feeling completely sick to my stomach and my thinking is we need to take all these to the police immediately. There's only so much I can overlook even for my own child. My ex she'd adamant that we don't get the authorities involved and instead get her straight into counseling, grounded indefinitely and all her devices taken away.\n\nI just don't think that's going far enough and I don't think we're capable of dealing with this on our own and covering up the crimes she has committed.

So, when we moved in together 4 years ago, I wanted to be as upfront as possible with him, and told him my own goal of being married and having started a family by 30. It\u2019s something that it important to me and on which I place a lot of meaning.\n\nHe always told me he pictured himself one day at the head of the family table with his wife and children. So, although he made it clear back then that he wasn\u2019t trying to get married \u201csoon,\u201d that was 4 years ago, and we\u2019ve frequently talked about having kids, names we like, and building our dream home together since then. This all made me feel like we were on the same page. \n\nWe have sat down and discussed getting engaged a few times. I\u2019ve been ready for about 2 years now. He....not so much. He says it\u2019s not ME, it\u2019s him questioning HIMSELF. Yet, he also says that it is really important to him that I get off antidepressants. To him, antidepressants are dangerous, and if I am going to be the mother of his children, he cannot have them born with any dependencies or mental setbacks, etc. He is ADAMENT that I can do whatever I want with my body as a human being, but if I want to be his wife I must get off antidepressants. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve told him a hundred times I have no intention of being on antidepressants forever, let alone while pregnant. I am on a small amount (20 mg) for depression/anxiety that I was diagnosed with at 19. Every time I have tried to ween myself off, I have plummeted into a crippling depression. So, I want to see a therapist to help me through the process. \n\nMy current job has shit insurance, and I haven\u2019t been able to pay to see a therapist. But, good news, I just scored a new job with awesome insurance, and I\u2019m planning on starting to see a therapist to help me with my depression/anxiety and ween me off the antidepressants ASAP. \n\nHere is where I need advice, because I feel incredibly hurt and honestly do not know what to do. I just find it....kind of fucked up that my bf is making me prove that I can get off antidepressants before he will propose. The way he says it, it makes me feel like he is testing my worthiness as a vessel for bearing children, instead of loving me unconditionally. I love him so much, and would never think to hold something like this over his head. I guess it just makes me feel like his love is conditional. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

As I parked my car on the street opposing her's I started talking to a colleague on my phone and a little later I saw our older sister's husband walk out of the house with my younger sister and they both kissed each other. I was shocked and confused. I waited for him to leave then stayed in the car for a while longer just thinking what to do. Finally, I got out of the car and went to her house and knocked on the door. She opened, let me in and I gave her the laptop case then sat down on her couch. I looked at her and told her what I saw. Her face reddened as I was explaining how disgusted I was then she just looked away with her hands on her face. She then started crying slightly and confessed that she and our BIL we're having an affair for the past 6 years. I was absolutely gobsmacked. Then I realised that her children, that she claims were from a sperm donor, are 5 and 2 years old which suggests they could be our BIL's biological children. I asked her if that's true and she started bawling and just nodded her head. I was speechless. She begged me not to tell sis and even started reminding me of how our relationship with sis is bad and that she was cruel to us growing up. She wants me to take her side and keep this secret from our older sis. I dislike my older sister but this is a form of betrayal that I think is deserved by absolutely nobody.

We are both in our 20s.\n\nI have been with my GF for 4 years. When we met, she told me that she was bisexual - we went 2 years without any attraction to females was apparent at all - so much so that I forgot. However since then she has been increasingly open about attraction to women. I am perfectly ok with this. She came out publicly a few months ago and our relationship did not change at all. \n\nHowever, a few nights ago, out of the blue, she said there was something that she needed to tell me - she said she has realised that she is not bisexual, but simply gay. She said she figured this out a couple of months ago.\n\nWe talked about our relationship and, I thought, that it was pretty clear that we had broken up. She discussed moving her things out of our bedroom and moving into the spare room. The following day she did this and I met her in IKEA to pick up a bed for her to sleep in. From the start I have said that I don't actually mind if we slept in the same bed but she repeatedly switched between thinking it would be weird to being something that she wanted. When we were in IKEA, about to checkout, she changed her mind again and we didn't get a bed. In fact, she said she wanted to pretend that the entire previous night didn't happen and we just continue as we always were. Since then, we have mostly done just that.\n\nThe thing is, I still have no idea what her sexual orientation is. After asking her, she has given the following answers (paraphrased):\n\n* I don't know\n* I'm gay, but with the exception of you\n* Something related to straight-gay spectrum\n\nIt's getting more and more difficult to know where we are at and I can't get a straight answer (pun not intended). She is getting irritated at me even asking about it and (paraphrased) claims that it is none of my business - she doesn't understand why I would need to know. On the other hand, I can't understand why she would think that I wouldn't need to know.\n\nBeing straight myself, I don't really have any experience with any of this.

I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.\n\nORIGINAL\n\nI received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.\n\nI was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.\n\nI did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. \n\nOne of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. \n\nIt kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.\n\nI have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!\n\nUPDATE\n\nI hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.\n\nTwo days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.\n\nYesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.\n\nMy wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.\n\nMeantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2179632, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist.

I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:\n\n**ORIGINAL** \n\nI \\[42M\\] am a single father to my daughter \\[14F\\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.\n\nAround Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nI was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.\n\nThe thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.\n\nAt this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nTL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSo today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. \n\nAfter the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   \nI wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \\[daughter's name\\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. \n\nNow I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?\n\nMy daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2179138, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573145925, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsj4nn/update_my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "acceptabledna", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_luh6aza", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573056085, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsiaos/i26f_think_my_bf_26m_was_in_a_relationship_when/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dsiaos", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 53, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsiaos/i26f_think_my_bf_26m_was_in_a_relationship_when/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1573056087, "score": 245, "selftext": "Basically, I met this guy and we started seeing eachother every week. He was interested and so was I, he was open about being into me and always made plans. There was no game playing. However, a few times while we were out I noticed a girl texting him, the same girl over and over again. I thought to myself: \"oh, he's dating other people\" and it was fine, I supposed he was. \n\nNow this girl is texting him every time we're out and I start getting a kick in my gut that she's more than just a date because she'd been texting him asking why he isn't answering and where is he. We had sex a month later and she texted him a voice message which he did not listen to (I was in the room) and he replied (I saw with my own eyes) \"I'm sorry i fell asleep\".\n\nWe get official and the texts stop, until, that is - we go out and I see her name pop out again and I confront him about it. He tells me a story about how they were an item but broke up a month before we started and that she texted him because he called her by accident on whatsapp (that didn't sit well with me either).\n\nI don't trust him anymore, my instinct is telling me that he was lying because a) why would any ex girl with an inch of self respect go \"crazy\" on you for not answering  texts if you two are clearly done? B) Why would you respond with \"i fell asleep\"? If you are dating someone else just say it. It gives a lot of closure and clarity. I just wanna know that I'm not crazy for trusting my eyes and instinct. \n\nI'm ready to break up with him because of this whole situation because I'd hate to have this done to me and when I put myself in the ex girls shoes I'd feel really bad.

Things were great from the get go, we started to spend every minute of everyday together (aside from work) and quickly became very very close. Things moved fast and within after six months we were living together.\n\nI was nervous because I had never lived with a significant other but after a couple of months I realised there was no need to worry as we became even closer and living together just enhanced the time we could spend with one another.\n\nFast forward to 15 months in and my partner tells me that her younger sister is having some trouble at home and she needs to come stay with us. My partner left home at the same age for very similar reasons so of course she could relate and felt an urge to help her. I agreed to this because I had met her sister before and we seemed to get along fine with one another and I really felt for the situation she was put into by her mum and wanted to help.\n\nShes been living with us for 3 months now and has been slowly pushing me and my girlfriend apart. I dont think is being done deliberately by her, but I cant help but feel that shes jealous of our relationship and how close/intimate we are. We've sacrificed everything to take her in, including our own room (we live in a 1BR apartment) just to try and give her a good life. From my side, I cook for them two nights a week, I pay 50% of the groceries, I've cut back on drinking because it makes the sister uncomfortable (I wasn't a binge drinker or anything, I just liked a few beers with some TV over the weelend) and have been giving her pocket money since she moved in. Theres other things here and there but those are the consistent things I've helped with.\n\nAs I mentioned mine and my GFs relationship has been deteriorating. She feels like I dont contribute enough or help her enough and that I am not sharing the burden with her. Because I havnt been getting attention from my GF I've started to pursue some things/hobbys that I've had on the long finger, but I feel like this is adding to the distance between us as I'm off doing my own thing instead of sitting at home with them.\n\nIt's all come to a boiling point over the last couple of days with her basically saying that unless my attitiude and my contributions change, it wont work between us and I should leave. I've told her that I dont want to put my entire life on hold for her sister, especially after giving up so much already.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some advice on all of the above ...\n\nMy head is spinning with confusion right now. Things were so good before her sister arrived and so I dont want to give up on that, but at the same time ..

I currently live and work back in my home country. Culturally, I identify more with my American side, and am far more fluent in English than that of my mother tongue.\n\nMy girlfriend (30F) is from a different east Asian country, born and raised. About 10 years ago, she moved to study abroad in my home country, where the language (and large portions of the culture) are unintelligible. Despite this, she had mostly assimilated, learning the culture and language in a way just short of a native.\n\nThree years ago, I moved to my mother country on a job offer and polished off my language skills.  \n\nWe met at work, and have been dating for over two and a half years now. I don't speak her mother tongue. She doesn't speak English. Our mutual language is that of my home country, a language which I am comfortably conversational, but lack complete fluency. Perhaps this was my greatest struggle.\n\nOur relationship was great. We cared for each other an unbelievable amount, putting in more than our fair share to make it work despite the obvious difficulties. I loved way way she looked at me and would scan my face to explore every pore. I loved her murmurs as she slept. I loved how she woke up, eyes closed, head tilted back as if booting up for the day. I loved how we bonded over food, or got excited about little things we had bought for each other on the way home.\n\nEvery step of the way, however, I couldn't shake the underlying issue of communication and cultural differences from being in the back of my mind. \n\nA natural extrovert, I find social life to be important. Most of my friends often couldn't communicate with her at all.  I slowly made it a point to find friends that we could both hang out with and not have language issues. \n\nShe, on the other hand, was never the outgoing type and her friends were largely those from her same country, and I was more often than not excluded in her infrequent outings. Netflix and chill nights were spent trawling the sparse options that allowed us to mutually consume content. \n\nFurthermore, I am a comedian and writer. She could neither understand completely why or how I make people laugh when I'm on stage. She was never able to read my work and appreciate it in the same way as others have. These are so integral to my identity, but she couldn't engage in that.\n\nMaybe she could never know me fully, I thought. \n\nPerhaps this manifested into bad habits: I was lately making some risky decisions with being around other women or staying out late, toeing the line emotionally without ever cheating. Perhaps I felt like things would make more sense if I did that. It didn't.\n\nI worried about the future. We are currently in the one country that would be the most logistically viable for us. One day, if we choose to leave, we were back in the USA, she would struggle with work or social life. In her home country, I would struggle the same. Realisitically, we'd have to nail down the language of our counterpart in order to communicate with friends and family back in our home country, and be okay with our unbalanced sacrifice in order make things work. It'd been almost three years together and we'd barely made any more than superficial progress in learning a third language.\n\nLast night, I broke up with her. Even now it feels like a bad dream. We live together, which added to the mess. That night, we slept in the same bed, just as we had a thousand times before. As I was asleep, she drank four airplane bottles, awakening me to the sound of her in the bathroom sobbing while throwing up. \n\nI feel like when it's just us two alone, it's the greatest relationship that I could ask for. We love and care for each other so much. \n\nLogistically, it made no sense. \n\nI figured I could no longer string her along until I could make sense of things. She's no longer in her 20s and mine is coming to a close. It's been almost three years and I still struggle with the same uncertainties that I had on day one. It wasn't fair for her.\n\nI think time will heal, as it always does. I can't help but feel this was a huge mistake, but I also think I'd feel like getting back with her would be delaying what felt inevitable.\n\n\\-\n\nSorry for this ramble, but I would appreciate your thoughts.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2177886, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (27M) broke up with my loving SO (30F) because of cultural differences and I'm having doubts.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573094164, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds9vmd/i_27m_broke_up_with_my_loving_so_30f_because_of/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shes420friendly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wneqpik", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573007583, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds9u56/my_bf25m_is_upset_because_i23f_said_i_wouldnt/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ds9u56", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 237, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds9u56/my_bf25m_is_upset_because_i23f_said_i_wouldnt/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1573007585, "score": 135, "selftext": "First reddit post, forgive me if I havent followed proper etiquette. \n\nMy boyfriend (m,25) and I (f,23) have been together for 4.5 years, and living together most of that time. We both are commited and plan on marrying each other. When we first started dating he was talking about his family name. He told me he wouldn't take is wife's name, but didn't care if she kept her own. His family is from a small town, and own a family business that has been passed down through 2 generations (he would be the 3rd). People know his name and his family in this town. I always planned on keeping my own last name, but never really expressed that.\n\nLast night during an unrelated fight, he was talking about keeping traditions. Trying to make a point, I told him that I didn't plan on taking his last name, and asked if he'd be ok breaking THAT tradition? He didn't address that question, we got on with what we were talking about, settled the fight, and moved on.\n\nTonight he brought the name thing up, and asked if I meant that or if I was just saying that because I was mad. I told him I meant it, and reminded him of what he said at the beginning of our relationship. He said he probably meant he'd be ok with his wife hyphenating, but that he always imagined being with someone who took his name. He said that he doesn't think he would be a good partner to me if I didn't take his name, that subliminally he wouldn't be giving 100%.\n\nI have a few reasons I want to keep my name.\n1. I'm not really the kind of person to do something soly because it's traditional. \n2. This tradition started to demonstrate which women were married, because a woman could only own property if she was married.\n3. I like my name, I like the way it sounds\n4. My father died when I was young, and I'd like to carry his legacy, and make my family proud with this name\n5. It's straight up a hassle to change your name\n6. As I stated above, people know his family, and his name means something to the people of this small town. I don't want that pressure. I already don't fit in here (I moved here with him a year ago), so I don't want any added pressure to keep up a certain image.\n\nHe thinks that I'm just trying to be a feminist, and that I'm putting an ideology before our relationship. He wants everyone to know that I'm with him (which I think the ring would be sufficient). I told him that if he hyphenated his name, I would hyphenate mine... but that doesn't seem to be a compromise that works for him. I told him we should probably just finish renovating the house we bought together, sell it, and go our seperate ways. He agreed.\n\nI feel like he's being unfair. I feel misunderstood. I told him this is a deal breaker for me. That I wouldn't take his name, and I would only hyphenate if he did as well.

We\u2019ve been married for five years. I\u2019ve known since middle school. \n\nI am very shy and quiet. I was near mute until I was six years old and I\u2019ve barely grown out of it. I will say nothing to people I don\u2019t know on a very personal level, and the rare times I do it\u2019s only a couple words and I speak too quietly for anyone to hear. The only people I\u2019ll talk to are my close family, my husband, my son, and a few friends who I\u2019ve had since childhood. And even to them I mostly only speak when spoken to, and I am not loud or very talkative. But I at least feel comfortable to speak. To anyone else, the thought of talking makes me feel sick and my hands shake. \n\nMy husband has spoken for me a lot. And I think he is growing tired of it. Last night he took me to dinner and he made me order myself. I couldn\u2019t believe it but he didn\u2019t give in. As soon as the waiter walked away, I cried. I  felt terrible the rest of the night. My heart was racing, and I wanted to throw up. He has never made me do that before and I don\u2019t understand. It felt cruel, it came out of nowhere. I asked him why he would do that and he told me I can\u2019t be so dependent for my whole life. He said he is enabling me, and I\u2019m going to have to learn to live on my own without him coddling me. He asked me what if he gets in an accident and dies, then what will I do. I didn\u2019t have the energy to argue so I just let it go.\n\nI feel really nervous and afraid. I cried myself to sleep last night. He told me he\u2019s just trying to help me, not hurt me.

I\u2019m not proud of what I did, but I ended up going through her phone and found messages between her &amp; her friends talking about a guy who is a regular at her work. Along with some other messages directly to the guy, but most were deleted. \n\nSome of the messages are as follows:\n\nHer saying to one of her best friends that I did not text her back so she was going to go over to this guys house instead. (She claims she never did and was just upset)\n\nHer telling this guy to come up to her work to visit her and saying how they have been vibing lately and it\u2019s not good. (Because she had a boyfriend) \n\nHim texting her saying she looked cute at work that day. \n\nOther red flags: \n\nA majority of the texts between him &amp; her were deleted. \n\nThere was a phone call from him to her just 5 days before I looked through the phone. \n\nShe claims nothing physical happened between them but they were flirting with each other for awhile. She claims they hung out twice with mutual friend groups, he tried to make a move on her, and she shut it down because she couldn\u2019t go through with it. \n\nI asked her why the fuck she was doing this behind my back and her excuse was that she felt like she didn\u2019t know if our relationship was 100% and she didn\u2019t know if it was going to last so she was seeking attention from someone else. \n\nI basically told her she was dead to me and I want nothing to do with her. She has been blowing my phone up constantly since I broke things off with her.\n\nWell, today I get a text from her saying she is getting a tattoo for me because she never wants to forget me and she loves me so much. I did not even respond. A few hours later she sends me a picture of the tattoo. It is my initials tattooed on the side of her neck under her ear. \n\nAt this point I just have no fucking idea what to think or feel. I have no proof that they did anything physical and she swears it was nothing more than flirting and hanging out with mutual friends. But I really don\u2019t care. That is still cheating in my eyes.

I was over the moon, I'd just got a new job the year before and was on such a high, life was really going my way. I loved my girlfriend so much, she was my world!\n\nFast forward to the end of July. Totally out of the blue, she announces that she's leaving me. It was a real shock. At first, I thought we would definitely get back together because her reasons for leaving me seemed really silly after 3 years together. She told me that I wasn't romantic enough and I didn't make her feel like I loved her. She said that I don't seem to want to go out and do stuff. Now, none of what she said was untrue; however, they were also really unfair IMO. With regards to the romance; none of my previous girlfriends were romantic people, they just weren't into it. Also, my girlfriend and I had never had a conversation about romance, if this was a problem for her, this was the first time I'd heard it. I couldn't believe she felt like I didn't love her. For a start, I told her I loved her almost every day, the first thing I'd do each day when I got in from work was to put my arms around her and give her a kiss, I was always very affectionate and it was always very honest affection. Finally, when we moved, I moved a fair bit away from all of my friends and I've also been having trouble with working different shifts with my friends and them not having money to do stuff. Also, my colleagues are almost all much older than me and married with kids so I don't hang out with people from work. She, on the other hand, is now living very close to all her friends (why we moved where we did, it was a concession on my part, I wanted to make her happy) and her work. After we moved, I fell into a bit of a rut because I wouldn't really know what to do with myself when the weekends rolled round. We would maybe go out for a nice lunch and for a walk, she would go out with her friends and feel bad about leaving me (she tells me later). Anyway, this kind of went on for about 2 months.\n\nI spend the first month after being dumped desperately trying to win her back. I mostly tried to engage her in conversation about how she felt, why she wasn't happy and what we could do to work things out. Literally everything she said was not working for her was all new news to me, which was really, really frustrating. But, at the same time, it also made me very hopeful because it's not like it was repeat problems that we'd tried and failed to overcome repeatedly. \n\nWhilst all this was going on, we were both still living in our house together during the week but we would both be going off to stay with our parents at the weekend. As 1 month turned into 3, I slowly started to give up hope for us and started looking into dealing with our living situation. This was hugely stressful, our home is a brand new build, and we just moved in this year and spent a bunch of money upgrading, if we sold, we would lose a tonne of money and I wouldn't be able to keep myself on the property ladder. She offered to buy me out, but were getting rejected by every lender we approached because of legal housing stuff that I won't bore you with. Also, to add to the stress, my ex left it entirely to me to sort all of this stuff and hasn't lifter a finger to deal with it.\n\nAbout mid October, I confronted her about leaving me for a work colleague of hers after I saw some pictures of them. She told me at first that they only just recently started dating and that he had nothing to do with her leaving me, but she quickly admitted that she did leave me for him when I pushed her on it and basically told her not to insult my intelligence. This one really stings because they had been friends. I've had this guy in my house, cooked food for him, played D&amp;D with him and been out for drinks with him; then I find out that my girlfriend left me for him. I had a strong suspicion that he liked my girlfriend, but I never said anything because I'm just not a jealous guy and I had complete faith in my girlfriend not to do anything - I thought she was as devoted to me as I was to her. At was at this point that I had a real emotional breakdown and was off work for about 3 weeks because I became really unstable. \n\nJust a few days ago, I was watching Netflix on her tablet and got curious and went into her calendar. She never used this tablet, and I only went into the calendar because I was feeling sad and kind of wanted to see if she ever put any of our very first dates in it (the kind of thing she would do). Anyway, I was surprised to realise that the calendar syncs with her phone, and I could actually see all of the dates and weekends she has spent with the new guy. The first one was the same week she left me. She didn't stay with her parents that first weekend, she stayed with him. I just now had a long conversation with her about how I felt about it all. I didn't shout or use particularly bad language or anything (not my style, I'm always very calm) but I told her I though that she was a bad person, that I couldn't possibly treat another person the way she has treated me and that I don't know how she can sleep at night knowing how many times over the past 4 months she has looked me in the eye and straight up lied to me, and tried to blame me for not being a better boyfriend. She got upset and left to go be with her new boyfriend. She said that he knows what to do with her when she is upset and that I never did. So, here I am now, typing this.\n\nYeah, as well, just because it's relevant to my emotional state, about a week or two after she left me my grandmother suffered a massive stroke and is now severely paralysed, stuck in hospital and in a lot of pain. Still in the same condition as I write this. We are very close, it is breaking  my heart to see her like this.\n\nSorry for the essay. I don't know what I'm expecting from putting this out there, but I just really wanted to share because I'm struggling to deal with it and I thought this might make me feel better.

My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.\n\nAround Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nI was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.\n\nThe thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.\n\nAt this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nTL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2177057, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573073098, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HorrorThis", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fgbeo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572983298, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds4gp2/any_time_i_28_f_raise_an_issue_to_my_husband_36_m/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ds4gp2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 68, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds4gp2/any_time_i_28_f_raise_an_issue_to_my_husband_36_m/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572983298, "score": 191, "selftext": "Basically my title explains it.

At first she told me she was on the pill so that was our primary contraception (no condoms), I had no reason to doubt her as I had seen her take her pill in the mornings whenever we would see each other and she seemed trustworthy. A couple of white lies came out after I\u2019d met her parents, things like embellishing her achievements in sports and school, but I wrote this off as early relationship nerves and wanting to impress me, she does have her insecurities.\n\nHowever as we\u2019re staying overnight more often I hadn\u2019t noticed her taking her pill in the mornings for the last couple of weeks, I figured she was probably taking it in the bathroom while getting ready so I ignored it for a little while (possible stupid mistake on my part, I know). Until a couple of days ago I outright asked her if she was still taking the pill, this is how the convo went:\n\nMe - Hey by the way, are you still taking the pill? \n\nA few moments of silence. \n\nHer - what? \n\nMe - The Pill. Are you still taking it? \n\nA few more moments of quiet, seems like she\u2019s trying to think of what to say.\n\nHer - erm... no.\n\nI asked her when she stopped and she said it was around a week ago, I\u2019m not sure how much I believe this as it\u2019s been a couple of weeks at least since I\u2019ve physically seen her take it. I was getting pissed off as we had by that point had completely unprotected sex at least twice if she\u2019s telling the truth about the timeframe. I told her this is something I should have known so I could\u2019ve made sure we had some other protection, she simply kept assuring me that if she got pregnant she wouldn\u2019t keep it but IMO this is not the point at all. She then took a pregnancy test straight away, I said I\u2019d like her to take another test after her next period to make sure as it was too soon after we were last intimate to be accurate. \n\nAt this point she began telling me that she doesn\u2019t think she can have children anyway, which is complete news to me and coupled with the little white lies at the start and hiding the fact that she\u2019d stopped taking her pill has almost made me lose all trust. She said that she didn\u2019t tell me straight away because she was scared of how to bring it up, and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to stop the good time we were having\u201d. I told her that we weren\u2019t having sex again until I knew for sure that she wasn\u2019t pregnant and we had adequate protection, she stayed a couple more days as planned and has now gone home which has given me my first chance to properly think about this. \n\nShe kept apologising and promised me that she wouldn\u2019t hide stuff like this in the future, but for this many lies to come out this early has filled me with doubts.\n\nWhat do you think?

Anyway..I recently found out some very hurtful and disturbing things out about him. \n\nI went through his phone (I know, I know) about 2-3 days in a row because I just had a feeling. There were emails for a new tumblr account, snapchats and weird message on kik.  I didn\u2019t have enough time to actually look at the kik txts but why would you have a kik and not tell me about it. Now before I continue, I have no problem with him looking at porn or him going out and having a great time with friends, he doesn\u2019t have to share everything with me but once you start getting weird with your phone, somethings up. The 4th day I asked for his phone and at first he didn\u2019t want to give it to me but eventually he did. I noticed that the app was deleted so I repeatedly asked why he did. He started crying saying it was nothing. He apparently was struggling with his sexuality...the way he went about it was completely disrespectful. I am very open minded, I\u2019m pan myself and I thought I\u2019d be the first he\u2019d come to about this. He was asking other men about how things worked like dates....I interjected that it\u2019d would work the same way. He meant sex. He basically role played with other people.  This was a month ago. \n\nI looked at his phone again 2 days ago bc I just can\u2019t trust him and he knows this. This time I asked for his permission first, so I go through his pictures and I start shaking. A screenshot from tumblr about some sick person that created a group chat for pictures of underaged girls. So I downloaded the app, signed in on his phone and saw not only the local hook up that was on kik but also 2 different groups for pictures of teens. \n\nI fucking lost it. I screamed and hit him and I don\u2019t do this but I just couldn\u2019t control myself. We\u2019ve been together for 2 years, just got married in May, bought a house (also in May) and I\u2019m pregnant. I kept saying what if someone looked at his 16yr old niece this way? You look at girls at the store this way while I\u2019m right there? I wanted him out but he won\u2019t go to his parents house because he\u2019s ashamed. \n\nHe\u2019s saying he\u2019ll go to therapy and kept saying he stopped and he knew he wanted to just didn\u2019t know how\u2019s. He only stopped both things because I caught him. I\u2019m sick to my stomach and I can\u2019t believe this is who I married. I\u2019m sorry that this was all over the place, it feels like it is.

We've been together for a year, been a pretty happy relationship with two major hiccups: \n\nI am completely against drinking, have never had a drink, and don't trust drunk people one bit. When I got with her, I didn't know that this was a part of her life but she said she only went to clubs to dance with the music and didn't drink. A couple couple months into the relationship, she went out of town with her girlfriends and got hammered for 4 nights in a row, as well as one night after coming back. She wouldn't admit it to me until I provided proof in the form of a conversation I overheard her having with a friend about how drunk they were. As far as I know, she was dancing with guys but didn't kiss or anything. When I confronted her she broke down and we agreed to continue the relationship on the grounds that she would stop drinking.\n\nOn another note, 2 months ago she started having doubts about me (wasn't sure I was the one etc); She opened up about these doubts with me a couple weeks ago but said that she was over them and not to worry. Around this same time, her ex messaged her a couple weeks ago on the 1 year anniversary of their relationship (together for 2 months) and had a quick conversation, but she didn't make anything of it and said it wasn't an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow moving on to last weekend: She went out with two of her girlfriends to a friends house where she started pregaming, and then ended up at a club where they spent the next 4 hours (we have location sharing on). The last message I got from her was at 10 pm that she was going to the coworkers house, and not a single form of communication until for the entire night. I found out from people that she got completely drunk, and was grinding/dancing provocatively with 2 guys for the greater part of two hours, I don't know what exactly that consisted of but I know they were essentially groping each other,  but no kissing involved. When her friends realized how bad the situation was they tried to remove her from the guy but she kept yelling \"let me have fun.\" On the uber ride from the club she kept talking about her ex that messaged her, the guys she was dancing with especially the inappropriate one saying \"he felt really good, must have had a nice belt buckle\", but not a single mention of her current boyfriend. When her friend brought me up she said \"He's great and I love him but he's not the one\" and started asking them if she should break up with me ( mind you she's pretty drunk still). She didn't come home that night, ended up sleeping at her girlfriends house at 4 AM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe texts me good morning the next day and they all come over to get ready to go to brunch and I can tell that her two friends are completely fine but shes mad hungover, I tell her we need to have a serious talk ASAP, and she says we will later. I ended up not going to brunch with them and they spend the rest of the day out going shopping etc and completely avoiding our talk. I am devastated and spent the entire day depressed and go to a friends house to sleep over. The next morning I go over and break up with her, telling her she destroyed my trust and I know she went out and got drunk. She cries for the next tow hours and is completely broken and begs me to come the next day to talk about it, and I agree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant: She doesn't know that I know about everything that happened at the club with the guys and her thoughts about breaking up with me. She only knows that I know she went to the club and had drinks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel devastated, and feel like she essentially cheated on me. I keep thinking about her grinding on multiple guys in the club and getting groped by them. I also feel very disrespected, and can't imagine my future wife would ever do something like this to me. WHAT SHOULD I DO/FEEL?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going over to her place in 10 hours, will update.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2176530, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My girlfriend (24F) went clubbing, got drunk, and danced inappropriately with guys.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nFor some context, we are a very normal upper-middle-class American family. We have been married for over 20 years and have three boys, now 18, 12, and 6. We have always provided a very stable home filled with love and support. We are very active in our childrens\u2019 lives and interests/activities. There has never been any economic instability, abuse of any kind, or substance abuse issues in our home. \n\nOur oldest son has created many problems for the family for the last 8-9 years or so. It started off with academic issues, essentially a refusal to engage and participate (there is nothing that happened around this time to precipitate this). He is remarkably smart, scoring a 112 on an IQ test that maxes out at 117, but just refused to do the work. Teachers and administrators thought he was just not challenged enough by the work, but we could not find a solution to get him to engage. \n\nShortly thereafter began the thievery and non-stop lying. He stole from schoolmates, neighbors, businesses, the list is endless. In one instance he used our emergency key to enter a neighbor\u2019s home, went into her purse, into her wallet, and stole hundreds of dollars. This neighbor is so close to our family that she often vacationed with us, and that relationship was destroyed. Ultimately, his thievery led to him being expelled from his high school. We had to place him elsewhere. At this same time, he was caught stealing at school, again. This time his defense was that he was stealing money to buy food because we did not have enough money to feed him at home. Though we were very well-known to be one of the more wealthy families in town, a school administrator saw this as a mandatory report incident, and reported the family to DFS, which started an investigation. That investigation was soon closed, of course. \n\nWe placed him in a mentorship program within his new school. The school resource officer was his mentor. This gentleman had mentored more than 20 other children in his career, successfully. After only two weeks, he told us he would no longer serve as mentor because our son was manipulative, lying, and continuing to steal, now from him. We attempted to get him mental health assistance, but every professional (literally, every one) ultimately refused to see him any longer as he was manipulative and we were informed that the therapies were actually making him a more refined and confident liar. \n\nLate last year we received a call from the school stating that our son had been accused of inappropriate sexual contact by numerous fellow students in his theater program. We were shocked as these kids were at our home almost daily, for months. Our son had the lead in the school play and they had been rehearsing. According to the resource officer, these activities were mutual between he and his peers, and others were being charged as well. In one instance a female classmate stated that she had \u201cso much homework to do that even (her) boobs are sad.\u201d In response my son grabbed her exposed bra straps, hiked them up, and told her to \u201cput on (her) big girl panties and get to work.\u201d She in turn slapped him on the ass. Both were ultimately charged. Our son was charged with 7 counts and a court date was set.\n\nThen, this past March, he came into our bedroom at 6am and told me there was a cop at the door that wanted to speak to me. I had just had a very large piece of commercial machinery delivered because my company\u2019s new commercial space was awaiting the occupancy permit, so I assumed he was there due to some complaint about the forklift in the driveway. Boy, was I wrong. I politely introduced myself and before I could finish speaking, our lives were forever changed. I suddenly noticed I could hear a helicopter approaching as the officer asked \u201cWho is in this residence?\u201d Before I could even answer, our home was raided by a multi-jurisdictional SWAT team. Every member of our family was literally drug out of their beds (my wife and other children) and we were lined up against the wall of our dining room at gun point. I was handcuffed in front of my children and drug out of my home to a waiting car. They had our street blocked off, a chopper hovering above, and about 40 people total, including DFS to take custody of my children. My then 5 year old was in hysterics about the \u201csoldiers in our house with guns.\u201d Neighbors were outside recording everything on their cell phones and streaming it live on Facebook. I just built the home and we had only moved in a few months earlier. There was our local police, county Sheriff\u2019s Dept., State Police, and the FBI. It was like a scene from a movie. I was informed that while this was going on at my home, my company\u2019s offices in two major US cities were also being raided. Additionally, warrants were being executed at my banks for financial records as well. \n\nI was very harshly questioned about my sources of income, my business activities, and most pointedly my sexual preferences and habits. It was so unreal. I just could not figure out what the hell was going on. At this point, one of the FBI agents shows me a thick file folder and informed me that I might as well come clean because they already know everything. He then told me that the warrant allowed them to remove every device from the premises (home and offices) capable of connecting to the internet. They took every phone, tablet, PC and Mac, TV, even removed the smart thermostats and home automation controllers. For hours they paraded evidence boxes out of my home. They searched every last inch. All the while DFS is questioning my wife and children. \n\nIt turns out my oldest son had opened an account with a social media platform, in my name. He had over 24gb of child pornography, which he stored on one of my company\u2019s servers. It included content of children as young as 5 years old. Because his phone was in my name, the home was in my name, the companies are mine, the servers belonged to my company....they thought they were raiding a 40 year old man who was distributing child porn. And potentially profiting from it.\n\nAbout a month after the raids, we had a court date for the charges at school. The day before that court date, we get a call from the school that our son broke into a science lab and stole approximately $500 from numerous backpacks. I was told he was being charged and would be taken to the police station. I then received a call that he had made suicidal comments and per law, was being transported to a facility for a 72 hour hold. I had no say over where he was taken (the county contracts with a specific facility). Turns out they were not in-network and it resulted in $55,000 in medical bills. They released him after 30 hours and stated that his suicidal comments were not genuine and that he was using his knowledge of the 72 hour mandatory hold to avoid the new charges and pending court date. \n\nNow, let\u2019s fast forward eight months since the raids. Because my son was still 17 when this happened, nothing is public record. There are now rumors circulating throughout the town that I am a money launderer, a drug kingpin, and my favorite: that I am a mob boss. I wish I were kidding here, folks. Of course I cannot address the situation without exposing the true nature of the raids, so I\u2019ve had no choice but to absorb the character blows. \n\nWe have been nothing but supportive. While he awaits trial, we got our son into a residential treatment house. He has 24/7 access to counselors and mental health professionals. We have brought Sunday dinner to him every week so we can eat as a family. I have literally bankrupted myself in legal fees and business ramifications. My home is in pre-foreclosure and my banks do not wish to do business with me any longer. I have millions of dollars in equipment sitting idle. His actions have literally cost me everything. Even through all this, and after over 4 months in this highly-respected residential program, he was again caught stealing from numerous stores and purchased a knife at a pawn shop, all in violation of the agreement with the DA that allows him to be in this program as opposed to juvenile detention while he awaits trial (as he was 17 at the time of the offenses). \n\nFolks, this literally covers about 10% of what we have been through with this child. I could simply write for days here to tell the full story. We are great parents and give every measure of ourselves to our boys. We have dinner together at the table every night unless I am traveling for work. Even then, I fly home if needed to be there for Sunday family dinner. Every. Single. Week. We hike, camp, are avid bikers, spend summers on the beach together, travel, and never miss the kids\u2019 events. We sit at the dining room table doing homework, and every single night we visit each boy\u2019s room just to talk one-on-one about their individual days, their friends, etc. I don\u2019t know in what way we failed our oldest child, but we cannot endure any more. We have two other sons to worry about, both remarkably successful in school, social acumen, and life in general. I need to rebuild my business and focus on them.\n\nI think it is time to quite literally disown him in pursuit of the family\u2019s best interests. The damage he has already done is immense, and he shows no remorse and is continuing the same patterns of behavior. I would just like some outside perspective in making this decision, as it is finite and irreversible.

We've been dating for nearly 6 years, and we used to live together. I'm the stereotypical starving actor working mainly plays and walking dogs as a side gig. He graduated from a decent state school and worked as a paralegal making barely more than I did, until about 3 and a half to 4 years ago he took the LSAT, did very well on it and got into a really good law program. One of the best in the country apparently (I don't know a lot about law school but all the sites say its like one of the top 3). Long distance was hard, but we made it work and I was very happy for him.\n\nHe's back now and working at a law firm in the city. We're going to move back in together once my lease is up in a month, and a couple weeks ago he took me out to a nice dinner, walked me down to a bridge where we had an early date, and proposed. I love him so I said yes (we had discussed marriage before anyway).\n\nFast forward to now, we're discussing finances. He's adamant he wants us to be a team and have joint finances and all that. He'd always been kind of cagey discussing how much he makes, but he couldn't exactly get around it now that we're going to get married. Turns out he makes an obscene amount of money now. Put bluntly it is over five TIMES what I make in a year. I didn't even know this was possible for someone to make that much their first year out of law school, but private practice pays well apparently. Sure he has some debt, but he's so good about keeping on top of it and living below his means that he's got enough saved up to pay his student loans for the next like five years already.\n\nI just feel kind of useless. The amount of money I contribute as someone who's been doing this half a decade is pathetic compared to the amount he makes less than a year out of law school. We used to have to scrabble together every penny and be frugal all the time and whole I definitely won't miss that, now I almost feel like I'm taking charity here. He's talking about this like its a partnership but really he is going to pay for basically everything as the majority of my money has to go to my student loans and credit card debt. And now I feel awful about every purchase or every expense. Yesterday we were talking about the wedding and every time something came up that seemed a little pricey I just died inside knowing he was basically fronting the entire cost for me.\n\nI don't even know where to begin to process this feeling, and I feel like it's only going to get worse as he moves up the corporate ladder so to speak. I want to talk to him about this but he's so excited about the way everything is going with the job and us moving back in and planning the wedding that I don't want to rain on his parade, he's usually such a serious person that having him be this happy for this long is very rare and I'd hate to make him feel guilty because I'm being weird or unreasonable about this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2176156, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (27F) am having a hard time dealing with the gap between me and my fiance's (28M) incomes.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573050836, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/drzy6v/i_27f_am_having_a_hard_time_dealing_with_the_gap/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mamiinsecure", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_403pi32t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572963814, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/drztee/my_boyfriend_18_says_he_cant_be_with_me_18f/", "gildings": {}, "id": "drztee", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 103, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/drztee/my_boyfriend_18_says_he_cant_be_with_me_18f/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572963815, "score": 143, "selftext": "My boyfriend wants the \u201cnext step\u201d in our relationship.

I am a 30 year old female that lives with my friend who is also a 30 year old female. It's her house, and I pay her a monthly rent. A few months ago, her family came to her and asked if she would allow her 16 year old male cousin to live with her \"for a few months\", in her spare bedroom. So 16 year old boy moves into the room next to me and we share a bathroom. Unrelated, but the first weekend he was here, he left his jelly-like masturbation sleeve right next to my toothbrush on the bathroom counter, so I've already got a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.\n\n( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nNow for this past weekend. I was out of town for the weekend. When I came back home, I noticed that my Neutrogena face wash wasn't in the shower where it usually was. I knew I had left it there because I never move that bottle. I peek into the teenage boy's room and low and behold, there is my lotion sitting on his desk. My mind starts racing. Why would he have my face wash on his desk? Does he not know that you're supposed to use water with it? Then the thought occurs to me- he's using my face wash to masturbate. I asked a few of my male colleagues who confirmed that that is probably what he's doing.\n\nI guess my question is, am I (likely) correct in my assumptions or am I totally off the mark?

She shouts from the bathroom to his room to talk to him. She'll stand where all the doors in the hall meet and talk to him when he's in his room or bathroom. She wakes me up 5 or 6 times every morning she's here, which is Friday through Monday, so half of the week. I told him once how little sleep I was getting and asked (pretty much begged) him to tell her to quiet down. Unfortunately the next weekend was the same. She woke me up 4 times one morning and I laid there, nearly with tears in my eyes thinking how I'm not going to get any sleep on the weekends anymore if things don't change and it infuriated me. I got up, slammed my door as hard as I fucking could and shouted loud enough that I hurt my throat for 3 days.\n\nI didn't see her for a week. I got one weekend in this new place so far with sleep on the weekend and it was pure bliss. But that's it. She came back last weekend and still pretends like I don't exist. I've asked my roommate twice now if we can sit down and talk about this but he won't. He doesn't do well with conflict, even though not talking is what is making the conflict. \n\nI should also mention his girlfriend attempted to move in without asking me or him about it. I was quite rude with my roommate when telling him she needs to get her shit out now. He claims he knew nothing about it and unfortunately I believe him. \n\nRemember when I said she makes him very happy? He'll do anything for her. He's shorted me on rent twice now because he spends so much on her. He cannot say no to her.\n\nI'm going to attempt to talk to him one more time and if he deflects or ignores me I'm going to tell him I'm putting my room on Craigslist and the first person the landlord approves is his new roommate. I'll get my own place where I'm respected as a housemate and maybe he'll get someone that'll let him disrespect them just so he has no conflict with his girlfriend.

We had our ups and downs, but overall I never really questioned that I loved her, and while she was a bit restrained in showing her emotions, she was always at my side, always reciprocal and always working extra hard to iron out any difficulties. For both of us this was the first long term serious relationship. Needless to say, we've been through a ton together.\n\nA year ago after a particularly heavy falling out she moved out, we made up a month later and things could not have been better after that. After 7 years it felt like a fresh relationship all over again. We took an amazing trip to France this past spring and I proposed to her. She looked slightly taken aback by this but she accepted. \n\nThings were fine after that but somehow she seemed to avoid marriage talks in general. Then, about 2 months later, she started getting more and more distant, despite my effort to win her back. \n\nThen, 3 weeks ago, she says that she's been participating in some online course on \"co-dependency\" and it helped her realize that what she felt towards me was not love, but more like gratitude for all the good that I was doing. She said that I gave her so much care and love that she had no choice but to do the same. And now, according to her, it's time for her to move on. \n\nWe had another talk just yesterday and she was still persistent in her \"it's not you it's me\" paradigm: you did everything right, I just never felt that spark and there's nothing you can do about it so don't even try. \n\nSo Reddit, what do I make of it?

Some of you asked me to update and I\u2019ve decided that I would. \n\nThere was a lot of concern about the possibility that I might have broken ribs from the assault. Upon going to the doctor and getting x-rays, I found out that while I suffered no breaks, he did bruise my ribs. Essentially I was told to rest and it should improve within 4-6 weeks. It still hurts to do just about anything involving movement. Deep breaths feel like a knife in my side. I\u2019m tempted to get a second opinion if it continues being this bad. My doctor didn\u2019t ask many questions about how I obtained my injures. I told him that I had a fall and he seemed to accept that story. \n\nI told my family what had happened shortly after going to the doctor. They came the following day to move me out of our flat. It was one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever done, but I am grateful to have them to get me through everyday. My parents were just as shocked as I was to learn that my ex boyfriend was capable of something so awful. They have urged me to file a report despite my decision not to. I do not want to go through that process. It\u2019s been a terrible ordeal that I want in the past. If I\u2019m honest perhaps there might be some loyalty to him inside me that doesn\u2019t want him in jail. We have taken photos of my injuries and saved texts (I\u2019ll get to that momentarily) should I need them in the future.\n\nWe explained the situation to my former landlord who was unexpectedly sympathetic. She let us break our lease without excess penalty other than keeping the deposit. \n\nMy ex boyfriend had been trying to get in contact with me from the day I asked him to leave. Endless phone calls and text messages that I never answered. His texts included apologies as well as promises to get help. I ended up calling him to tell him that I had moved out. To my surprise he didn\u2019t fight me. He agreed that it was for the best though he was clearly heartbroken. We have both completely moved now and I have no intention on contacting him further. \n \nI\u2019m trying to be strong, but in my darkest moments I miss him. I miss my life. I miss waking up to and going to bed with my best friend. I miss talking to him. I miss the love we had for 3 years. I miss the person that I used to be; confident and brave. I\u2019m fucking scared all the time now. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll never be able to trust anyone in the same way I trusted him. I miss not being in pain. I\u2019m angry at him for ruining everything and angry at myself for not seeing the signs. I alternate between being in utter denial to despair. This has been the worst experience of my life that sometimes feels like it\u2019s impossible I\u2019ll ever smile again. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about me taking him back. Telling my family cemented that that will never happen. As for the rest of it, I don\u2019t know. \n\nForgive me for any grammatical errors.

Basically me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 5 months and during sex, he has continuously brought up that he really wants to have a threesome. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the idea and told him, but he continued to ask so I said \u2018why don\u2019t we do it with another guy?\u2019 as I thought he would say no and stop asking. He said he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the idea but I just brushed it off and hoped he would stop asking. Well tonight he invited me over for dinner and to hangout which is normal. He really wanted to smoke weed which I found odd as he never has before, and have a couple drinks which I did. He then mentioned that his male friend was going to come by to pick something up. When this friend arrived he immediately sat down right next to me and started asking me about myself. I started to feel extremely anxious as I realized that this friend was obviously not there to pick something up. My boyfriend then brought me into his room which made me start freaking out more. He told me that his friend was leaving and we eventually started having sex even though I was so confused and apprehensive. Well his friend ends up coming into the room and we end up having a threesome even though I continuously told me boyfriend I didn\u2019t want to and felt uncomfortable. I gave up trying to stop it as I felt so weird and in the end I just wanted to make my boyfriend happy. I absolutely hated it and feel ashamed of myself. I\u2019m so worried that im going to see this other guy on the street or he\u2019ll somehow end up spreading what happened. Half of me feels like I led my boyfriend on and I shouldn\u2019t feel upset but the other half of me feels like he ambushed me???

I've talked to him about this numerous times and he has agreed with me before that it's an issue and he wants to fix it and get up with me but yet here we are. I've been awake for hours cleaning the house taking care of the dogs and getting ready to go to work while hes in bed. If I wake him up hes a total dick and we fight.

I haven\u2019t spoken to him ever since we were kids because he used to molest me as I slept and I\u2019d wake up in different clothes that I fell asleep in and things of the sort.\n\nA lot of that time is a blur because of time and I think I\u2019ve blocked out some of the bad parts that aren\u2019t worth terrorising myself out these days.\n\nAnyways. In high school, I had severe depression and anxiety and was pretty suicidal but I got therapy in my 10 or 11th year for it. But after I told my therapist about what I hate and feel guilt for the most, about my brother, she told my dad that she was going to report that and in turn, my dad told my mom and when I got home, my mom yelled at me for the better half of an hour.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest, I can\u2019t remember most of what she said but I did record it (i deleted it later because of guilt I felt) and long story short, I stopped going to the therapist even though I really needed to.\n\n\nSome years passed and my family had a reunion here, and while here, I told two of my cousins what happened. One of those cousins is moving over here soon and he\u2019s a bit of a loud mouth and he told all my aunts and anyone who could hear that he was going to hurt my brother for what he did.\n\nNaturally, this got around to my mom and once again, she yelled at me, but this time I managed to choke out my point of view because I can confidently say, she doesn\u2019t scare me anymore. No one can scare me anymore. And no one can make me feel guilty for telling people about what happened to me.\n\nEven so, I cry all the time when I talk about this so I was really choked up but I still fought back and I recorded it again, but this time it only lasted no more than 6 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s for the most part in Spanish, but i finally have a recording that I won\u2019t delete.. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with it but it makes me feel a bit more secure if that makes sense? As if she\u2019s gonna try to deny what happened though..\n\nIt mainly consists of her yelling at me that mistakes happen when people are kids and that I have no idea how embarrassed she is that \u201ceveryone\u201d knows about what happened and how obviously I\u2019m not ashamed about anything that\u2019s happened since I\u2019m telling the whole world about it.\n\nI retorted that this isn\u2019t about her and how dare she feel embarrassed for protecting him and not sharing it. I would also say that I\u2019m not ashamed of what happened, I won\u2019t feel shame for something I had no control of. I also told her if she\u2019s feeling this way, maybe she\u2019s the one who needs therapy and that seemed to quiet her down a bit..\n\nRelating it to the group, I guess I could do with some advice on how I should go about this? I know I\u2019m not guilty of anything wrong because I honestly just told people what happened and it spread from there.. I don\u2019t think my dad knows yet since he\u2019s not home. \n\nUsually when she gets mad at me, she ignores me for a few days entirely but now, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do.. I don\u2019t want this to blow up at all, but I\u2019m scared if it does. \n\nHow should I talk/approach her?

I feel as though this is on me. \n\nI've known my wife, I'll call her Katie, since we were in grade school together. We grew up on the same block, our families were good friends, and she was always that one person you could be with and not say anything at all and it wouldn't be weird or awkward. Everything just felt right and normal with her. I started developing feelings for her around sophomore year of high school. Unfortunately, she didn't feel the same way and later on she started dating one of the guys in our friend group, I'll call him Dan. We still remained good friends, thats the kind of person she is.\n\nI wasn't super close with Dan, he was one of the guys who you never hungout with alone, but he was always there with the group and he was always nice. Dan and Katie dated through college and ended up getting married a few years after graduation. I had stayed close with Katie throughout this time, and it fucking killed me seeing her with him. I knew there was nothing I could do, but he was happy with Dan and that is all I wanted for her. I got over her and had a few short relationships, but I never felt the same way.They had a kid together and stayed in the same area from back home. We didn't see each other as much, but with social media we were able to keep up well.\n\nDan passed away about four years into their marriage. It was incredibly sudden and unexpected. Her folks had her at an older age, so at this time they were pretty elderly and retired in a different state. She became depressed and had bad anxiety. They came back for a few months and stayed with her and that was all they could afford to do. I work odd hours so I had been coming by and helping out around the house and with her kid. One night I stayed for dinner, we drank wine and hooked up. I felt my old feelings for her again. We didn't talk about it, and it started to become a once a week kind of thing. Eventually told her how I felt and she said she felt the same we started dating. She was still depressed but was seeing someone and I think her kid kept her going. \n\nI proposed after she after a year or so and she accepted. We have a toddler. She hasn't really been as open as she usually is the last few months. I found out she's been going to see Dan's grave every week too. And I don't fault her for that, but I only include this because she really never went to see him. We haven't slept together in months either because she says she just doesn't feel like it. I just feel incredibly isolated. I don't blame her for missing Dan.  I thought maybe I could convince her to love me once we began dating, but I now know you can't force anything.

(Yes, but I didn't tell him that)). \n\n3 years in and we've had many arguments (due to differing opinions on political and social issues) and many times were I told her I just can't do this anymore. \n\nI've literally told her I need a break. I want to break up. I don't want to be stringing you along. \n\nAnd yet here we are. 3 years in and she's expecting me to propose to her. I know it's my fault for misleading her to this extent but I've tried... Half assedly to break away but I just can't do it. \n\nI have no one in my life. And yet with her I still feel this \"longing\" for more, for someone/thing else. \n\nI keep going back to her. \n\nShe knows about all this. I feel she too is in this vulnerable / limbo state. She hasn't dated much (if at all) and I'm \"her first one\". I've told her she needs to experience more and from different/\"better\" people. \nBut she says she only wants to experience things with me. \n\nI'm so fucking lost it ain't even funny anymore. \nIve blamed a lot of the problems in our relationship on my depression (it's not totally a lie), but a lot of the depression is also coming from \"me\" not being \"happy\". \n\nI've woken up crying due to the stress I'm experiencing. I've never experienced that before and it's frightening and sad. \n\nHer birthday is coming up real soon and I just want to disappear. \n\nI just don't know what's \"real\" anymore and what to do/who to turn to.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2173883, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gf (F32) expecting proposal soon.

This was my first time meeting him and initially, I was glad to get to. When she saw him however, her face absolutely lit up and she got this very high pitched voice to say \u201chi\u201d.

I told her right away that I thought that was messed up and I couldn\u2019t even be around her. We spent the rest of the event apart. I didn\u2019t want to fight in front of our guest. Later that night, I asked her why she chose those words. She said she didn\u2019t know and I never got a real answer back. She just said she loved me, etc..

We are both always concerned with the iud birthing me. I\u2019m not excited about sex for fear of being stabbed, and she\u2019s anxious about stabbing me. She gives me blowjobs a couple times a week, but honestly its becoming more like getting the job taken care of than something I look forward to.\n\nWe recently move into our own place. Excited to have our first sex christening the new bed, alone, no visitors to worry about. We have some foreplay as I guess that is supposed to lengthen the vaginal canal or whatever. Not even 3 seconds in I feel the stabbing. I try to ignore it, switch to a different angle, not go in as deep. Honestly I felt like the tip of my dick was injured and did not want to continue sex at all. \n\nI\u2019m just disappointed. I feel like this IUD is ruining our relationship. Sex stirs up anxiety, pain, disappointment, and resentment.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.

So for those of you who told me to \"neck myself\" and everyone who decided that my relationship with my children was ruined forever, I sincerely pity how terrible a relationship you had with your parents and hope you never breed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, my last post yielded little advice and consisted mostly of people telling me  how fucked everything was (shoutout to u/sabreyna for actually giving some advice) so I decided to just ignore you all and do what I thought was best. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to see my sister on the Saturday morning and when I arrived she seemed surprised to see me but invited me in anyway. She explained that her shortness over text was because she was dealing with her own problems with her/my children. She told me that Cousin was being bullied by my Daughter at school apparently for no reason. I realized it must be about her blabbing about the tape so I explained the situation (leaving out the contents of the tape obviously cause I'm not stupid). She decided to punish her daughter for being disrespectful of someone indulging sensitive information and we agreed that I would talk to my daughter about how wrong her behavior had been. (Yes she is religious but she isn't insane and she doesn't judge me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to let my kids stew without their electronics until the Sunday while I helped my wife pull herself out of her shame spiral. After a long day of helping and supporting her she seemed to snap out of it and slept peacefully for the first time since this all happened which I was very grateful for. On the Sunday we decided as a team to sit down with our kids and talk to them again. We started with out daughter as she seemed easier to deal with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe sat her down and I explained to her that what she did was similar to me reading her diary and then telling other people what was written in it. There's nothing wrong with having a diary and there's certainly nothing wrong with what was written in it, but it is embarrassing to have others know.  She understood the example and apologized. We then got onto the topic of the cousin and explained that, while what cousin did was very wrong, she shouldn't be so hard on her and to stop with the bullying. Our daughter agreed although she said their friendship was done and I said that was fair enough. We gave her back her electronics and reduced the grounding to a week (what she did was still wrong and so requires punishment).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe next called down our son and talked to him about why he was punished. His mother is his mother and no child, regardless of the reason, has any right to talk to their mother the way he did, same goes for me. He apologized for what he said and then we talked about schools and if he wanted to change school. He was genuinely scared that we were going to switch his schools and he explained that the bullying wasn't that bad, just some \"loser kids\" who were throwing stuff at him and hassling him in the halls. My son is very well liked at his school and has many friends and loves his sports so we decided not to move school. I did the same with him that I did with my daughter and gave him back his electronics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the week I got a call from his school that he had been in a fight and was facing suspension so I went to the school and it turns out he got fed up of the harassment and beat up one of the \"bullies\". The principal was talking serious punishment but I told him to fuck himself and explained that my son was standing up for himself against people who were using sensitive information to bully him. At the end of the day it was decided that a series of detentions was more appropriate for both people involved which we accepted as a compromise. I told my son I was proud of him for standing up for himself and that he wouldn't get any punishment at home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the whole community finding out, well it turns out that adults don't tend to believe children when they talk gossip (shocking I know) and all that is known is that my wife and I have a sex tape. So no one cares, or at least no one we care about cares. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we are back to a sort of normal. The kids are talking to us again and eating dinner at the table and we are all a lot calmer, if still a bit tense. In the future we will be A LOT more careful about this kind of thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo address a few things from the last post: Yes the world isn't fair, but why should I then teach my children to contribute to that unfairness? Answer: I shouldn't.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy just punish the kids, what about your punishment? LOL parenting isn't quid-pro-quo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe laptop did have a password on it. It was unlocked as I had been using it barely 10 minutes earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is nothing wrong, neither morally nor ethically, with recording a sex tape of consenting adults. People calling me and my wife degenerates can crawl back to whatever sad little hole they crawled out of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I wont bother reading any replies to this so spare me your vitriol.

I didn't realize that I was **taking care of her**, not being her husband. I don't really know if she killed it and I allowed it to die, or if I switched gears somewhere, killed it, and she allowed it to die.\n\nEvery single choice that comes up in our lives is met with a certain degree of panic. Hyperventilation, heart palpitations, jittering hands, crying, shaking, eventual numbness where she's very cold and unfeeling, and 3-4 day spans (on average) of a mish-mash of all those behaviors. I never know what's around the corner.\n\nI can watch her face change, and in a second I know when fun and normalcy has come to a screeching halt, and I have no control over it. I know all her triggers, I know when we're in public that someone talking on their cell phone while vaguely looking in her direction for any length of time will set her off, I know that hearing names that relate to the names of her family (whom she has cut off connections with) will set her off, and I know that I have to choose every single word of every single sentence carefully so it doesn't come off in a way that makes her worry.\n\nThat's where my fault comes in. I've essentially coddled her and taken on all the things she didn't want to. She's made about four phone calls in half a decade, because somehow I'm always the one that has to do it. If there's a knock on the door or our neighbors are in their yards for too long, the next three days of my life are a living hell.\n\nAs you might imagine, all that anxiety doesn't leave much time for a relationship. I give everything, and I get nothing. Our sex life is gone, the romance is gone, she has let herself go, she doesn't try to be attractive or alluring like she used to, she's depressed (if that wasn't a given), and I try to help her with all of that. I try to tell myself that some things don't bother me, I let them slide, and then I build up resentment.\n\nThat's not fair to her. It goes from being a living, waking hell for her, to unfair and isolated/lonely for me, and then being unfair to her because I hold it all in, and some of it leaks out. I feel like a caretaker who has to look out for her, not a lover who have the privilege of supporting her.\n\nThe complicated part, and why I'm asking for help, is that we have children. Young kids. We have a very integrated (and as I've come to find out recently, co-dependent) existence. I let her use sex to turn me away from my friends, so I have nobody left who wants to deal with me - and I can't blame them for that, it just took too long to see what was going on. I turned a blind eye to my family. When one of them died violently, her anxiety was stronger than her need to support me as her husband.\n\n**She would rather let the anxiety win than ask her family for help.** She wouldn't even ask her family to watch the kids so she could accompany me to the wake, nor the funeral. She just stayed home with the kids while I went and did it alone. I think that was the day I fully realized we were no longer in a partnership, and that was four years ago.\n\nI have since spent my time looking up more than enough firsthand accounts from men and women who have spouses that suffer from anxiety. I know it's a selfish mental disease. I understand that it's not fair to the person suffering from it, but how much longer can I go on pretending that I'm not suffering by osmosis, either?\n\nI'm miserable. She's panicked. I think I messed up by doing what I thought was protecting her for far too long.\n\nI've shielded her from it. From all of it. Instead of bearing through the worst of it with her, I've become her armor, and she hasn't cared to maintain it.\n\nI love her, but I no longer love myself. I want her to be happy, but I've exhausted myself trying to help her. I love our children to no end, but I can't bear the thought of them having another father figure if we were to split up.\n\nI have well over a decade to go until the youngest is old enough. I want a solution in between staying together for the kids, and being happy while actually enjoying my life. I don't know if one exists, but maybe you could all enlighten me.\n\nI thank you for reading all of this. Maybe you'll reply, maybe you'll shrug it off, I don't really know. All I know is that there's no handbook on how to be happy. I was happy, and I didn't know it, so I traded it away in exchange for what I'm living now. I'd appreciate any words of wisdom or analytical feedback.\n\nSorry if there are any typos. A bit emotional right now, as you can tell, and I don't care to reread what I've just written.\n\n**TL;DR:** Wife's anxiety runs our life, dictates choices, and spoiled all intimacy/romance.

We\u2019ve been together for almost 12 years and married for 5. About 3 months before we got married she went to a friends birthday party. A friend that I already didn\u2019t like because she was pretty trashy and was known to be pretty active in drugs and heavy partying.  I told her I wasn\u2019t very comfortable with it but I\u2019m not the kinda guy to say don\u2019t go. I just asked her to be smart and probably would avoid drinking. The next day she\u2019s not responding to me for hours. I was told by a mutual friend I need to call her because he thinks some stuff went down.  She eventually texts me after about 6 hours and tells me shes going to the hospital because she was sexually assaulted. She said she had one drink and blacked out. That she was drugged and remembered a guy friend of hers trying to take advantage of her and she kept telling him to stop but he wouldn\u2019t. A friend of hers walked in on them and said all of their clothes were off but they weren\u2019t having sex yet. I was super angry because I said this exact kinda thing could happen but ultimately she was sexually assaulted. I kept in my feelings of anger because in the end no one should ever blame someone for being sexually assaulted. I had a hard time because she didn\u2019t want to press charges. She just wanted it to be done with. I respected her wish. We got passed it and got married. Here\u2019s where the true problem comes into play. \n\nA year ago we were looking for an old friends contact so she activated her old Facebook account. While she\u2019s looking through messages I see a conversation between her and the guy who assaulted her. The conversation didn\u2019t have anything super guilty. Definitely very friendly but that was about it. The problem was it\u2019s not the kind of conversation you would have with someone who harmed you. I started questioning her and some truth came out. She was drinking all day and night at the party. She knew exactly what happened the end of the night. She didn\u2019t want to press charges because she wasn\u2019t sure if he forced her. It turns out they were making out in front of a bunch of people before they ended up in the bedroom. She claims she doesn\u2019t know if she had sex with him but claiming it was sexual assault was wrong. It\u2019s a big deal because we have only been with each other. I feel like our whole marriage is a sham and over this last year I haven\u2019t been able to forgive her. She knowingly cheated and lied about 2 huge things and now I\u2019m confused on what I should do. My anger over the last year says I should leave her. My brain tells me I shouldn\u2019t be with anyone who can lie about shot like that. My 12 year relationship that I thought was amazing says I should stay.

I know this is \"above reddit's paygrade\", but we're looking for advice wherever we can get it.\n\nWe've been together for 5 years. My husband grew up extremely hard, in one of the worst areas in the country. He was heavily involved in crime and dealt with violence on a constant basis. For going on ten years, he's been through numerous rehabilitation programs, mentors teens who experience similar circumstances and he's absolutely turned himself around. He's never been threatening in the time I've known him, although he still deals with anxiety related ptsd triggers on occasion.\n\nFor Halloween, I got the idea to prank him after he got back from a late shift, at which point I'm usually asleep. I hid behind the shower curtain in my costume, which was of a cat burglar (picture the black ski masked crook shimmying down a wire past those lasers to steal a diamond like in movies). I'm 5'9, and this costume made me look a bit bulky. He came in quietly, and when he came into washroom I popped out from behind the curtain. Before I could reveal the joke, he attacked me. It was severe, and I couldn't tell him who I was as he had my throat, and my hands were under me in the tub. He screamed my name and told me to run, and started giving extremely dark threats to \"me\" telling me what he planned to do when \"his wife got out\", outright telling me he planned to kill me while continuing the assault and screaming my name. This only ended when my mask was pulled in a way that revealed my dyed hair through the eye holes and he pulled it off, seeing it was me.\n\nHe spends the rest of the night an inconsolable mess, and I had to actively stop him from calling the police on himself, from taking me to the hospital and from calling my friends and family, because I knew no matter what I said he'd end up arrested. I entirely blame myself for this, I knew his past, I knew he dealt with ptsd and I pranked him without thinking of how trapped he'd feel in that room or how protective he'd be of me. At the same time, I'm terrified. Not rationally, but reactively. I knew his history, but to experience it scared me beyond belief. The sheer violence of his attack and his threats and anger made me realize just what's still under the surface if pushed, even though my rational brain knows he was reacting to what he thought was a threat and he's been a gentle teddybear towards everyone for the entire time I've known him. He on the other hand blames himself entirely, has been crying on and off since Halloween and keeps apologizing, begging me to just leave him which I have no plans or desire to do. My face looks like I went through a meat grinder, and I cannot go into work or face my family like this, because I doubt they'd believe what actually happened. \n\nWe both just want to move forward from this nightmare. Please do not advise me to leave him, he's an amazing man who reacted to my ridiculous idea of a joke. What steps can we take to be around friends and family while I heal? What steps can we take to close this gap between us, put it behind us and love and support one another through this experience? What can I do to ease his guilt, while also reminding myself he's still the amazing man I married and not the person I encountered that night?

I was showing signs of what I think now is bipolar disorder. Food soon wasn\u2019t enough to cope with such terrible mood swings, I switched over to drugs and started to self medicate my problems. It was only when I started getting delusions at 15 that I decided to tell someone. \n\nThat someone was my parents. It was very nerve racking to tell my parents that not everything is alright and I was secretly struggling. But none the less, I mustered the courage and told them about both the drug use and my mood swings. \n\nThey acted in a totally different way than I expected. They told me that mental illness doesn\u2019t exist and that I need to stop reading into mental health. They told me I was a drug addict and that I was going to hell.

They told me if I was sent to the psych ward my life would be ruined and I would never get the job I wanted, I was naive and did everything they said. I acted as though everything was fine for 3 mental evaluations. They let me go on the third day as I was seen as not a threat to myself. \n\nCut to yesterday, I was having a conversation with my uncle about his struggles when he tells me about how hard it was to have a mom with schizophrenia. I had never heard of my grandmas illness and I asked him what he meant by that. He was confused at first that I had never heard of her illness but told stories about what it was like with her and how she found the right meds after a while.\n\nI\u2019m just in disbelief as I can\u2019t believe my parents denied me help and told me my struggles weren\u2019t real. I have gone down very dark sides of addiction that could have been avoided if I was medicated. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I am supposed to do with this information. I want to question my parents but I don\u2019t think that would lead me to any help.

I apologise for the long descriptions, but feel they are relevant to understanding the situation. Sorry for any typos, and there is a tl;dr at the end.\n\nI (45F) have three daughters- 22F, 21F, and 17F. I\u2019ve done my best to create an open and supportive environment for all three of them, and I feel that I mostly have. My eldest two daughters have both been quite successful in life- they both have jobs, are in university (my eldest just graduated with honours!) and are in loving relationships. They have (as far as I am aware- but we are a very open family) always practiced safe sex with people who have respected them, and have avoided using any hard drugs (but have used some weed). I thought I was doing a pretty good job creating independent adults.\n\nThe issues with my youngest started a year or two ago. She started showing great stress from school and a general hatred of some subjects. She has also had great deals of friendship drama follow her throughout her time in school, but they have seemingly become more volatile over the past year, constantly fighting with friends and changing to new friends. To deal with this, I had her see various psychologists and psychiatrists until she found one she liked, tried to help her change to less stressful subjects at school, and hired her a tutor. She recently was accepted into a beauty school for next year which she seemed happy with, so I was happy. \n\nOver the past year, she also became very attached to me and would share every detail of her life with me- she would constantly say things like \u201cI\u2019m actually obsessed with you- it\u2019s unhealthy\u201d. For example, she would get mad at me if I didn\u2019t come to her room to check on her every 30 or so minutes when I was home. Her psychiatrist suggested she might suffer from borderline personality disorder, but she refused treatment and I didn\u2019t want to push things with her.\n\nAbout four months ago, she told me that most of her friends had lost their virginity and she wanted to get it over and done with, and had therefore decided to get tinder and lose her virginity. I was somewhat apprehensive, but I realise that she has a licence and me telling her not to do something will have no impact on her, so I encouraged her to be safe. After that, she began a stream of sleeping with lots of men in a very short time frame. She always had sex on the first date and would say things like \u201cyou know me- I can\u2019t force myself to wait more than an hour or two until I get to have sex\u201d. I have no idea how many people she slept with, but at least 10 in that time. She attempted to have some exclusive relationships with various men, but if they did something like leave her message on \u201cseen\u201d she would get angry and have sex with a new person as revenge. \n\nMeanwhile, she began using weed very frequently with her friends along with some other party drugs. She asked me for money to buy ecstasy and that\u2019s where I said no (she used her own money though anyway- but I give her pocket money as she has no job, so it was very conflicting and I felt somewhat powerless still). I am unsure exactly how many drugs she has done or how often. Since she started sleeping with men she has been much less needy with me. \n\nThis brings me to recently, where she seems to have gone off the deep end entirely. She\u2019s told me she has prostituted herself twice. She said the first time was because \u201cif I\u2019m sleeping with randoms anyway I may as well get money\u201d . The second time was to pay me back for a Halloween party she hosted (this party was also an early 18th, as she turns 18 in a month, and she was not at any point expected to pay for it). \n\nFollowing this Halloween party, much has happened. My eldest daughter lent her an expensive Wonder Woman costume for her party, and lent her room for my youngest to sleep in, so other friends could use 17F\u2019s room. However, 17F decided she was mad at my eldest that night after she told 17F to wear red lipstick with the costume, and told her friends to be rude to my eldest, who subsequently left to her partners house for the night. The next morning, when my eldest returned, she found that her favourite ring had gone missing from her dresser. She yelled at 17F for allowing it to get stolen, but 17f said it was her fault for leaving it in an obvious place (in her bedroom on her jewellery stand??) and called my eldest daughter ungrateful, along with many other horrible things (I don\u2019t understand why she used the word ungrateful, as my eldest had actually lent her lots of things for the party). She then attacked my eldest daughter and ripped her clothing. \n\nI was very alarmed by this incident and tried to talk to her about it later. She showed no remorse, explaining that she wishes she\u2019d hurt my eldest more and that she should get stabbed. I\u2019m genuinely concerned for her safety and my husband has told her to stay at her boyfriends house for a few days because he is also scared for her safety. What\u2019s worse, is that when 17F was out today, I searched the house for the missing ring (hoping it had been misplaced) and found several other pieces of missing jewellery from 22F and 21F in 17F\u2019s room, hidden away. I assumed that the ring was stolen by a party guest, but now I am very concerned. She is currently mad at me for telling her that how she treated eldest is unacceptable, but is okay with my husband. My husband is convinced she is on harder drugs, citing the fact that she\u2019s recently taken up prostitution and is acting particularly volatile, and has been walking a funny way. Overall, things are pretty messy.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem- I think she needs to be hospitalised (in a mental health hospital). We have private health insurance and we have a very good healthcare system. My eldest daughter was hospitalised in the same system last year after a suicide attempt and she said the hospital was fantastic, and I also saw the hospital. I know she would be in good hands. \n\nHere is the problem though- my daughter would be unwilling to go, so I would have to lie to her to get her there and then have her hospitalised against her own will, which I am apprehensive about (my eldest found the program with her partner and went voluntarily). Also, her final exam for school is in a week. I understand she can get an extension, but it seems like a mean thing to do and stressful for her to hospitalise her at this time. Also, she finishes high school in a few weeks and has booked a party house in a big party city with some friends to celebrate. I know there will outlet be hard drugs, but she has been waiting for this for the past several months and I know she would likely miss the event if I hospitalised her now. \n\nFor anyone still reading, thank you. I truly don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nTl;dr- my daughter (17F) has been having problems with friends and school for the past year. This has escalated to her changing friendship groups, experimenting with drugs, and very suddenly sleeping with lots of strangers. Over the last few days, I have discovered she\u2019s been stealing jewellery from her sisters, and has started prostituting herself. She has also been volatile and physically aggressive with my eldest, pretty much unprovoked, and shows no remorse. She may be  on drugs (??). She probably needs to be hospitalised, but if I do so now, she will miss her final highachool exam and also a big party holiday she has planned with her friends.

It wasn\u2019t a deal breaker, and I didn\u2019t think to much of it.\n\nNow, a couple of days ago I went to visit him and i am currently staying at his place, the thing is that he is really insisting on me taking showers in certain moments. When we first met he told he showers both in the morning and evening. I said fine, I shower only in the evening, and the topic was over.\n\nThis time tho is different. On the top of the shower I take right before going into bed, in the morning he\u2019d put a lot of pressure on me to shower, to the point I\u2019m obligated to do so. He\u2019d start saying how he would feel dirty, not fresh, how it\u2019s just not right. When I told him that I literally showered before going to bed and literally hadn\u2019t done anything or went out just like him he said that he would still feel dirty. When I asked him if he thought that I was dirty he didn\u2019t answer and just gave a weird look.\n\nAnother situation is straight after sex, he\u2019d put me in a position where I can\u2019t say no. I\u2019d obviously still clean up, but he explicitly asks me to get up and get a shower no matter what time it is.\nThis happens every single time and puts a lot of pressure on me, because he usually asks me to have a shower before sex too and it\u2019s just mentally draining.\n\nIf I refuse to shower he starts giving me looks, asking multiple times if I won\u2019t shower and I just feel dirty and unclean in general even if he doesn\u2019t say it.\n\nI tried to talk to him multiple times in a calm and rational way to ask why he felt this way and explain logically to him that I felt and was for a fact clean and didn\u2019t need that many showers in a day. He won\u2019t listen to me or accept my point of view. \nI\u2019d also like to add that I am a fairly skinny girl and don\u2019t have any sweating problems.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this situation?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2170211, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My(20F) boyfriend(27M) won\u2019t stop making me to shower multiple times a day", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572875081, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dr0jmg/my20f_boyfriend27m_wont_stop_making_me_to_shower/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Florentina5052", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2srdb6ci", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572783008, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqzkmv/my_boyfriend_has_halfnaked_screenshots_of_girls/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dqzkmv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 183, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqzkmv/my_boyfriend_has_halfnaked_screenshots_of_girls/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572783009, "score": 1039, "selftext": "My boyfriend and I (we\u2019ll call him M) have been dating for over two years now.

Sorry in advance, I've got a fair few thoughts and they're just confusing me right now.\n\nI'm being adopted into a family soon, I have spent time with them a little in foster care and they've decided to let me join their family permanently. While I'm grateful, I have some concerns that are eating away at me and I want to bring them up so hopefully people can help.\n\nFirstly, I don't talk. I have some mental condition the doctors say is similar to aphasia, apparently it sometimes affects reading ability too but I can read fine, I'm just mute. While they've reacted to me well so far, I'm very worried that once the new shine wears off they may just find me irritating or not like me because of that. It's stressful because I don't know how they will take having to go to the extra effort to do simple communication just for me. Maybe I'm overthinking but it worries me.\n\nSecondly, they have 2 children already, and I haven't really gotten to know them. Most of the time I was with them previously was during day times not staying at their home and I haven't stayed more than 1 night before so I've only really seen them. I'm anxious about how they'll feel about me entering their space and I don't know how their parents have handled the situation with them so it's a major concern for me. What if they think I'm weird? What if they hate me because they feel like I'm coming to steal attention or something? I'm just not sure how to approach the situation with them and I'm scared.\n\nOther than addressing those 2 things, the whole thing has me excited but scared and I'm not sure about anything really. I know I need to make an effort on impressions and be useful around so they don't get annoyed with me or something but I'm not really sure what else.

That people can/will so easily lie and use you, without caring. The idea that I'll see things that look like hints of cheating and have to expend so much energy/mental-wellbeing just to figure out it. \n\nI've been cheated on and she convinced me I was overbearing and crazy for months until I found out. I don't care that she cheated as much as that I was used and lied to and fell for it.\n\nI see posts on here every other day with men/women asking for advice about things that *seem* like their partner is cheating. I couldn't imagine the pain of being with someone for *10 years* only for them to cheat and try to manipulate you to the point you don't know what to believe or do.\n\nI understand and am okay with people being attracted to people outside the relationship, because in a 20+ year marriage there is no way you're not going to be attracted to other people. \n\nAttraction is fine, but it's the part about trust and someone wanting to keep you and have their side engagement too, so they try to play you. Instead of being honest and saying they want someone else, and maybe it's time to break up, they wanna keep a happy home and get something else through lying and manipulating. \n\nEvery time I seriously think about being in a long term relationship this destroys me. I've went to therapy for months and I feel at peace with being cheated on, and my trust issues have went away pretty much. \n\nBut the fact that I know relationships need a certain level of distance and trust to work, and I also know how *easy* it is to abuse that distance and trust in a way your partner will *never* know about, it drives me nuts. \n\nSome dude just made a post about his wife coming home with a hickey and lying about it and I'm just so sorry for the dude. It's fucking devastating getting lied to and cheated on by a girlfriend, I couldn't imagine the pain of getting played like that by someone you've dedicated your life too. \n\nAnybody have any advice on how I can get over this without becoming a paranoid trust-freak or just putting myself in the same vulnerable position as before?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2169697, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The thought of being cheated on is hindering me from being in a relationship.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572853491, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqxdsv/the_thought_of_being_cheated_on_is_hindering_me/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "justathrowaway7788", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4x3lm1nu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572764694, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqx34z/girlfriends_nudes_all_over_the_internet/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dqx34z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 310, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqx34z/girlfriends_nudes_all_over_the_internet/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572764695, "score": 343, "selftext": "Hi everyone. I\u2019ve been debating for a few days now whether I should post this or not but I really need some thoughts/advice/support on this and I don\u2019t really have anyone I can talk to so here we go...\n\nI\u2019ve been with my current girlfriend (27) for just over 3 years now. We recently moved in together and things couldn\u2019t be better. That is until last weekend when I logged into my Facebook. I don\u2019t really use FB anymore but still have a look every couple of months. I noticed that I had a few message requests (the ones that you get from people you\u2019re not friends with and don\u2019t immediately show up in your regular inbox, they\u2019re kind of hidden). I opened one of the messages from someone who obviously wasn\u2019t using theirs real name. The account was pretty much empty with no activity, basically just a throwaway. The message simply read: \u201cHi - what do you think about this?\u201d and it had a link in it. Now I wouldn\u2019t normally click on it but curiosity got the best of me and so I did. As soon as the page opened, my heart sunk. It was an album of various nudes of my girlfriend on one of the major porn sites that every guy knows. I was in shock. There were around 170 pictures, obviously taken over a couple of years probably (different hairstyles and whatnot). The pictures were extremely explicit, full nudes with her face showing, spread legs, in various locations and even some with another guy literally with his cock in her mouth and in her pussy. Most of the pictures were clearly taken by someone as opposed to just being selfies.\n\nI happened to be alone at home and spent the next hour or so reverse searching the pictures on Google. Turns out the pictures are ALL OVER the Internet, mostly on Russian sites (she\u2019s originally from Eastern Europe). From what I could tell some of the pictures we posted 5-6 years ago. On one site, one of her albums received over 65,000 views and almost 1,400 comments. I was destroyed.\n\nI\u2019ve always known that my girlfriend was very kinky, more than the average girl but I honestly didn\u2019t think that I would ever discover something like this about her. Later that day, my girlfriend came home and I decided to pretend like nothing happened. I still don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t confront her immediately or why I still haven\u2019t done so in the meantime. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of how she\u2019ll react and I\u2019m not even sure that she is aware of the fact that her nudes are all over the Internet. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t responded to the person who sent me the link either.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2169634, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Girlfriend\u2019s nudes all over the Internet", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572851061, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqx34z/girlfriends_nudes_all_over_the_internet/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRAgold", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4xnehcbh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572752642, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqvcm1/my_f30_husband_m34_is_having_an_affair_and/", "gilded": 1, "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "id": "dqvcm1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1284, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqvcm1/my_f30_husband_m34_is_having_an_affair_and/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572752646, "score": 10422, "selftext": "I\u2019ve had suspicions about my husband\u2019s fidelity but I always tried to tell myself I am being paranoid.

I didn\u2019t want to be a jealous insecure woman and that\u2019s how he made me felt if I said anything. \n\nBut Thursday, his card statements came in the mail and I just decided to look. I thought what\u2019s the harm in just seeing if there\u2019s anything. But there were constant hotel charges, and even ones at a florist and jewelry store. I just didn\u2019t want to lie to myself anymore and I really couldn\u2019t, so I showed it to him when he came home from work. All I did was ask what it was and told him not to lie. He told me \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth if that\u2019s what you want\u201d. I nodded and he said he\u2019s been seeing this woman for a little, he told me \u201cit\u2019s just sex, you know it\u2019s different with you you\u2019re my wife\u201d. He told me he doesn\u2019t love her, he only loves me. He said I am more beautiful. I asked him why he wants more than me and he told me \u201cbecause I would never fuck you the way I fuck her\u201d. I don\u2019t really understand what he means but I am trying to imagine. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to make me feel better, but I started to tear up. I just felt so defeated and all my energy was gone so I walked away from him. And I\u2019ve been very distant since, I\u2019ve been almost silent I\u2019ve only said a few words.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to bribe me like I\u2019m a child. Flowers and gifts. He\u2019s already given me chocolate, wine, perfume, lotion, essential oils, candles, and jewelry he\u2019s gave me a very nice bracelet and a necklace I\u2019ve been wanting. He\u2019s left them for me but I haven\u2019t touched his gifts other than to see what it is, I don\u2019t want them. It\u2019s like it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day but we aren\u2019t talking. He\u2019s at least given me the space that I want, he doesn\u2019t push me to speak to him and he\u2019s not sleeping in our bedroom. \n\nI feel sad but it\u2019s a numb sadness. I am less emotional about it than I thought I would be. I feel more petry emotions than strong hurt or anger right now. What more could he want? I try to be perfect for him I don\u2019t see where I\u2019m lacking. What do his words mean? Is there any hope he\u2019ll stop? I rely on financially, we have a son, and I still love him so it\u2019s hard for me to imagine leaving. But should I? I just can\u2019t think with any clarity on my own, my judgement is clouded.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 4 years. Before we started dating, I was messaging another guy and sent him sexy pics a few times. When my boyfriend and I started dating, the other guy would still hit me up asking for pics. I felt uncomfortable, but he told me if I didn't send them he would tell my boyfriend about other ones I've sent. For some reason, this logic made sense at the time so I sent more pics.

When I realized that my relationship was getting more serious, I cut all ties with the other guy and told him I felt very uncomfortable and this could never happen again. I never told my boyfriend.\n\nA few years later, my boyfriend started becoming closer friends with the guy. I am constantly reminded of what I did years ago. I feel like it is too late to tell my boyfriend, but I feel so incredibly guilty. It's been 4 years and I still get sick to my stomach thinking about how horrible of a person I was. I've never done anything like it since and have been faithful to my boyfriend.\n\nWe are talking about moving in together next year and I'm worried that if our relationship continues to move forward, I will either feel guilty forever or tell my boyfriend and he will break up with me. I'm not sure if I can live with the guilt but I'm worried that if I tell him, he will be confused, unsure why I'm bringing this up now and not years ago, mad, angry, upset, etc... What do I do? Should I be honest and tell him what happened? How should I tell him? Should I try to forget about it since it was so long ago? Would you break up with someone for sending inappropriate pics years ago? \n\nTL;DR I sent sexy pics to a guy a few months into my relationship.

I love her very much, she\u2019s an incredible woman. The last 8 months have been amazing, but something recently occurred which has caused me significant distress. Here\u2019s the story...\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I had a particularly busy time at work. My job is very busy normally, so my gf and I try and schedule set nights per week that we can spend the night at each others apartments/dates etc. Leading up to the incident in question, due to some work scheduling issues, I was working very late and unpredictable hours, more so than usual. During the early part of the week of the incident, I wasn\u2019t able to see my gf for some of these previously scheduled nights.  She was frustrated with this but very understanding, and we talked on the phone before bed etc (everything Seemed ok). Then comes Friday night. I was scheduled to work late, and we had  planned for me to come over to her apartment late after work (11/Midnight) so we could spend the weekend together. Early Friday evening (6PM), she texted me that some of her gym friends were going out, and she was debating going. I encouraged her, and told her I\u2019d let her know when I was off work, so we could coordinate getting back to her apartment...\n\nSeveral hours later, I get some very odd texts. First it was just pictures of her and her friends. Then a very odd text \u201cyou don\u2019t care about me\u201d. I called immediately, no answer. I texted her to call me, and she responded \u201cno\u201d. Really distressed and confused, I called her again. This time she picked up, and she sounded a little drunk (she\u2019s not a big drinker). I asked what was wrong and, while she sounded anxious/stressed, she didn\u2019t elaborate despite my prodding. I asked her if I could meet her at her apartment in an hour and she said sure, her voice perking up at this. \n\nAn hour passes, and by about midnight I arrive at the apartment very anxious about the nights events, expecting to have a heartfelt conversation about what happened, presumably stress from my busy work schedule. I open the door, and there\u2019s a dude my age I\u2019ve never seen before sitting there, eating pizza/drinking wine with my girlfriend in her somewhat revealing pajamas.  My gf greets me with her characteristic huge smile and a \u201chi baby\u201d as if nothing out of the ordinary has occurred. She introduces her friend as one of the guys from her gym who lives at her apt. I\u2019m visibly startled, but act normal (I think), and the three of us have a pleasant conversation. He says it\u2019s getting late and leaves, hugging my GF and shaking my hand. My girlfriend is still her normal bubbly self as he departs, and proceeds to ask about my day. \n\nObviously I\u2019m shocked at the events that have transpired. I stop her and ask her exactly what is going on, notably how is it that there\u2019s a man in my GFs apartment I\u2019ve never met having wine with my GF in her pajamas. She blows it off at first, then realizes how worked up I am. When I explain the context, she immediately apologizes, saying she didn\u2019t realize  that this might make me uncomfortable, and apologizes profusely. I told her that this guy (straight single handsome male) almost certainly has malicious intentions with respect to our relationship (while I had never met him before, she had mentioned his name, and called him a flirt while at the gym). I mean am I wrong? What single guy goes to an attractive woman\u2019s apartment at 11PM on a Friday night and has wine without physical intimacy as a final destination?\n\nAnyway, days pass, and she profusely apologized, saying she loves me so much and is so sorry. I forgive her, saying that this is not a behavior that I can tolerate in a relationship, to which she agrees. \n\n(For background, this type of thing has never occurred between us before. We\u2019re a secure couple, we trust each out her, never questioning the other when we go out with friends/on trips separately)\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing...while shes sorry that the situation makes me uncomfortable and feels badly about it, she claims that she was completely oblivious to this guys advances. She claims that she honestly believed that this dude just wanted to have a glass of wine/pizza/nice conversation in her apartment, and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the optics of it. I do believe her, she\u2019s never demonstrated any behavior remotely like this before/we\u2019re not a \u201cjealous couple\u201d. But that claim of obliviousness to this dudes intentions continues to bother me. Really, can a woman really be that oblivious? Especially one who is VERY attractive like my GF, and gets hit on frequently when we go out? Is it possible that she knew what she was doing, perhaps in response to me canceling on her earlier in the week?

But we recently moved in together in September, its a  temporary living situation in until I\u2019m done with grad school. \n\nBefore we lived together there were signs that he had bad hygiene, for example after we would have sex and on many occasions there would be a really strong musty scent in my sheets, I just thought it was because he sweats a lot. Other times there would be streaks... smh. Again I thought it was due to sweat. And then theres his bad breathe and he doesn\u2019t clean his ears, like if you\u2019re standing next to him you can see the wax build up, clear as day. Its really gross.\n\nSince moving in together, I\u2019ve notice other things, he doesn\u2019t shower for days, maybe like 2 sometimes 3 days out of the week. We had raw anal sex recently, and then he got dressed and went to work the next day and didnt shower until the day after that day. Every time we\u2019ve had sex since ive started noticing his habits, ive had to ask \u201cdid you shower?\u201d. He doesnt brush at night. And just now, like 10 mins ago, i heard him in the bathroom taking a dump, because he leaves the door open, then he flushed and walked out. I was like \u201ci didnt hear you wash your hands just now\u201d, he said \u201cmy hand didnt touch my butt, the wipes did\u201d.... who says that?! \n\nI am beyond disgusted and mad at myself for being so naiive about those signs before we lived together. Ive had conversations with him about his dirty ears and his breath and his showering. He jokes about it like its funny but its nasty.

So we moved cities in early July, I quit my job to look after our kids so my Wife wouldn\u2019t be so stressed and have to worry about school pick up, drop off and day care and looking after the house.\nShe had a very bitchy workplace and the IT guy in the beginning tried to guide her through what people she should communicate. She was opening a brand new workplace not to far from there main head quarters. So she need constant IT support and quickly began a friendship with him. In the beginning I would ask her all about work and everything that would happen, this lasted about a month and a half when she finally snapped and told me she doesn\u2019t like me asking about it so much.\nAt her new workplace she would do half days there and would sometimes have to go back to the main head quarters unless she needed IT problems fixed where she could stay and she would tell me how excited she is that she didn\u2019t have to go. \nI was trying to find a job though it has been really tough to find one in this new city. She told me that there was a training night that was up in the air for a couple of days whether she should go or not. The training night went until 9 o\u2019clock after she finished her shift at 5. She then told me there was a managers conference interstate that also was up in the air whether or not she could go and that she would have to pay for her own flights though she would get reimbursed next pay. I dropped her off at the airport with my children after their bedtimes and she left for 3 days. I caught her deleting messages while she was parking the car at our house. When I confronted her about it I was yelled at called a psycho and she told me that it was just nothing and I had no reason not to trust her I felt ashamed in confronting her.\nShe would always talk about how great of a friend this IT guy was and how excited how she didn\u2019t have to go to the headquarters for half days. I was always suspicious of this though I didn\u2019t always say anything I would question her about it and on 2 occasions drove around her work building on an afternoon that he was supposed to be there, I just never went into the parking garage because I convinced myself I was crazy and that they were just working.\nShe became very distant to my children and me. She would say hello to me, my kids and then go to the toilet and shower then would hang out with my kids for an hour until their bed time then go to our room away from me for the rest of the night saying she has a massive headache.. When we would fight she would say I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to you about anything and say that I was nothing more than her babysitter. We would have sex maybe 3-4 times a month, I haven\u2019t initiated it for maybe a year due to constant rejection only doing it when she requests it\nShe came home on Monday and told me she was on the phone to him on the way home and told me that he told her that he had to hang up on her because his wife got angry when he talked to pretty girls after hours and told me he was such a great friend because he could relate with what was going on in the office. Initially I thought that it was a bit weird thing to say that to the opposite sex if they\u2019re your work colleague. The night carried on as it usually did but what she said was all I could think about so after she fell asleep I took her phone and tried to enter the passcode which I had always known. The passcode didn\u2019t work and I started shaking I bursted into the room at 1015 waking up demanding for her to show me her text messages she refused and told me it was because I woke her up and she had work in the morning. She told me that she promised that I\u2019d be able to see them in the morning and she needed to go to sleep and didn\u2019t have time for me to over analyse her text messages I told her that I would watch her all night so nothing was deleted. After 30 minutes I heard her start to snore so I went to the toilet then went to sleep. We both woke up at 5am on her alarm and I demanded to see her phone like she promised we argued about this for 2 hours during which she looked at me in my eyes and smiled saying when you went to the toilet I deleted messages from the IT guy. This enraged me I was crying begging for her show me her phone she left home 1 hour early for work.\nI was on the phone to her telling her that she should tell the IT that they should only have a professional relationship and no more personal stuff tell her that I need proof of this conversation either text or recorded phone call she refused telling me that I was crazy and I needed to get a job and I had no reason not to trust her she told . I started asking questions about all of her suspicious behaviour and logging into our mobile service provider where I found 400 text messages and 20 MMS and phone calls to this IT and I also found a screenshot of a question about her interstate trip and not long after a record of a picture message sent. We were texting constantly about this all day with me begging for her to tell him no personal stuff anymore. \nShe came home early and told me that she slept with him once 3-4 weeks ago and they flirted a bit. I was enraged and tried calling IT, then I called their front desk telling the person what I have just been told. She told me that he was going to tell his pregnant wife about the affair. I packed up my kids and left for her parents house where we store our caravan to live in to get away from her. I researched this guy all night online and eventually found his wife\u2019s phone number on Facebook at 3am. I waited till morning at 8 am I called her and told her everything, she didn\u2019t even know who my wife was. I sent her all my evidence and she confronted him. My wife was still going to work and I was so crazy I would text her and call her all day to try and find out what really happened trying to dig at her social media accounts and Telstra accounts I found out by his wife that it was ongoing for 2 months and the interstate work trip was a lie which was confirmed by seeing payslips with no reimbursement and holiday pay. She admitted that after I told her that I was told by the other women. She has continuously lied to me after I have caught her and I have to press every detail for the truth. I feel like I need to find out everything she has done to me. She has told me she would do anything for another chance. I have told her that without honesty I can\u2019t move past it because I can see every time she lies. Everyday I have been finding out new things like using training nights as an excuse to go out for dinner. The interstate trip kills me the most because of all the planning and deceit and fake conversations. I was so proud that she got the opportunity to go I\u2019d tell all of our family. I have found out that they would send dirty messages and photos to each other. I have found out that they would tell each other that they loved each other and she has said she still loves him but doesn\u2019t want to be with him. He asked her about making another trip and spoke about how in different circumstances they would be together.\n I have been letting her see our children as much as she wants and she is telling me that she still loves me and wants me to give her another chance. I have told her I need complete honesty to even consider it. I have never seen any messages between them and I could of but after multiple requests she deleted her Instagram where I could of retrieved dms. Before she did it she said she has told me all that was on there I.e. saying I love you a lot, dirty messages and dreams of being together. But I can\u2019t see them now and I told her that I needed to. When she said she loves me she pauses like she has been doing while lying. I don\u2019t know what to do. I love her so much but this pain is so bad I don\u2019t know if she is saying it to me for our kids or for me. I need help. I stayed with her and talked about things which was mainly me asking details about it. I even had sex with her. I feel like she is manipulating me again.

I clearly did not want to have sex. I came out of my bathroom and said I think he should go and I offered to book a taxi for him. \n\nHe refused, offered to help me get into bed (which I couldn\u2019t do anyways because I needed to get him out of my flat- it needs a key card to access the exit) he started taking my clothes off and I started to put my pjs on.

I have been extremely private with my personal life for my entire life. My husband is very aware that I like to keep my personal life private. \n\nMy dad left me and my siblings when I was 14. He moved just a few streets away but decided he never wanted to have anything to do with us again. So I would see him around town occasionally but he would just always act like I didn\u2019t exist. I had to drop out of high school my senior year after my mom was arrested to take care of my little sisters while working two jobs. \n\nMy life was hard and it sucked for a long time. I eventually went back to school, got my masters in accounting, I\u2019m a CPA, I work for a global public accounting firm, I bought a home and later met my husband. I keep my personal history extremely private. I have told my husband and maybe 2 other people in my life. \n\nThis year my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I found out because my cousin posted about it on FB, I had not seen or spoken to my dad (except once at a court hearing) for 17 years. We called to see if we could come say goodbye before he died - he said no, that we weren\u2019t welcome and had no interest in seeing us and then he died a few weeks later. \n\nAlso this year my mom was arrested for her 5th dui after being physically abusive to my grandma and my sisters. So I needed to kind of deal with that out of no where.  After everything calmed down a bit with that I started processing stuff. I had never dealt with anything from my childhood - and my dad dying was just kind of a huge gut punch for me. I became extremely depressed and started drinking in a really unhealthy way (drank to just numb out and not think about my childhood). This went on for about 6 weeks - I then talked to a therapist and told my husband I had a drinking problem and checked into a detox and then a 30 day rehab / trauma program. \n\nIt was amazing. I dealt with so much that I had just never dealt with before - it was life changing and life saving. I\u2019m so glad that I did it. \n\nWhen I left for the program I made it extremely clear to my husband that I didn\u2019t want any of these details from my life shared with others. He could tell people that I was with my family in the city where my family is and that\u2019s it. He agreed and said he absolutely understood that it was my story to tell when and how I was ready and not his place to share. \n\nI came back from the program and everything was good then I found out about two months later that he told our mutual friends about my problem with drinking - after he had specifically told me that he hadn\u2019t and he had also told them about my dad abandoning me / not wanting me / and that he died and told me he didn\u2019t want to see me before he died (he said this is all he told them but who actually knows since he initially lied and said he didn\u2019t tell anyone anything, then he lied and said it was just his one best friend, then it turned out it was his one best friend and his fianc\u00e9, and then it was also best friend\u2019s parents and then it was also another friend... and that\u2019s what I know about so far). \n\nI am honestly furious. I am extremely private and I have been my whole life and I feel like he has stolen my privacy from me and totally betrayed me. I also felt like a fool - because I told these people that I was getting some help, but never gave details - but was clearly not honest with them. So I feel like I\u2019m painted as a foolish liar. \n\nHe said he did it because he was overwhelmed by the whole situation and needed to talk to someone. I think that is why we paid for a therapist for him.  \n\nI don\u2019t know how to get past this. These people are his really good friends - so we spend a lot of time with them and I just feel so hurt and betrayed every time we spend time with them because all I can think about is how he told them my painful past. I also just feel really bad about myself when we\u2019re around them. \n\nTl;dr: my (31F) husband (31M) shared with friends some personal details that I specifically asked him not to.

When we got there, we both decided we wanted some hot chips and decided to each a $2 punnet of chips each. My boyfriend got to the cashier and was placing his order, so I said \"Do you mind just paying for mine at the same time please? Just so this lady doesn't have to bother doing two transactions.\" He sighed, and said \"Can you pay for it then since I drove us out here, to compensate for petrol?\" So, I placed the order for us. \n\nWe went outside the store to wait for our food, and I said to him \"Look, you should of just paid, honestly. I don't really want to feel like I owe you petrol money and it kind of just spoils the carefree feeling of the night.\" He got pissed off, and then my emotions got in the way so we ended up ignoring each other for most of the evening. Then, on the drive home he started raging at me for evening asking him to pay for me. \n\nHere were his main arguments:\n\n* He works full-time and saves all his money. My rebuttle to this is that he goes out drinking every weekend, and can obviously quite clearly afford buying me some hot chips.\n* He feels like he doesn't need to buy me anything. To which I would say, well I do everything (in terms of laundry, housekeeping, cooking, buying groceries).\n* That if I asked \"nicely\" and \"femininely\" then maybe he would buy me some takeout every now and then. And obviously this irritates me because I do nice things for him all the time without him asking, just because you know I love him and that's what you do for people you love.\n* And then he went on about extra stuff that is completely unrelated saying things like \"You're just a normy. You don't understand my interests. You're so boring\"\n* And that he gets on the defensive side when I \"act negative\" and that I should of just said to him \"Oh, babe, please just buy the chips for me?\" But of course, I'm not going to be like that because I'm already pissed off that I have to approach it that way, considering he SHOULD just be naturally caring towards me but he's not.\n\nAm I the issue here or is this shit just ridiculous and tiring and I should be able to go out with my boyfriend and have him feel like I don't owe him something for it??? We have been together for 1.5 yrs. \n\nTL-DR; boyfriend never pays for anything for me, he treats me like I'm a flatmate.

I talk to the dude who supplies everyone and I point blank ask if she did coke. He stares off concerned for a few seconds and looks at me. \"I'm not going to lie to you, she did.\" \n\nSo I leave the party and tell her that I'm tired. I go home and go to bed.

Absolutely at a loss here. \n\nSo my husband makes me an energy smoothie on mornings I go to the gym. He has been doing this for the past couple months. I used to make them myself and when he started getting up early wanting to do it for me, I thought it was such a sweet thing.\n\nNow today, this morning, I came in the kitchen to see him with his pants down and penis out, masturbating with one hand, the other holding the blender container in front of his penis. He hadn't noticed me because his eyes were closed, he was very shall we say engrossed. I didn't quite believe what I was seeing. I said \"what are you doing?\" This whole moment is kind of a blur, but what I remember is he startled a bit, and then all at the same time he let go of his penis, started to say something, and ejaculated into the blender. \n\nThe fast-forward version of what happened after is that we had a huge fight, I was just in shock and so disgusted, I felt like I didn't even know him. Why the hell would he do something like that. \n\nHe kept insisting this was the only time he'd done it. I said that's bullshit because ever since he started making the smoothies they tasted a little different in a way I couldn't place. I'd shown him exactly how to make them so I realized I'd just found the reason why. He kept denying it and saying I was imagining a different taste. So if he's done it before he's not admitting. He wouldn't answer the WHY either. First said it was just a joke. Then said he wasn't thinking and it seemed like \"a hot idea\" in the moment because he was horny. Yeah okay, says the guy with the sex drive of a rock who barely even looks at porn let alone initiates anything with me. I'm like so were you gonna blend all that shit up like that and give it to me? He goes WTF OF COURSE NOT WHY WOULD I DO THAT. Well I don't know, why would you JACK OFF INTO MY SMOOTHIE in the first place???\n\nSo he just kept being defensive, then aggressive and eventually said this was going to make him late for work, and stormed off upstairs to get dressed. He didn't even have to go to work for another hour.\n\nI'm furious. I feel so gross and just angry, we've been in marriage counseling since the summer and I thought things were really turning around. We used to argue a lot and now we hardly ever do (until this). He cut back a lot on his gaming, started doing his share of chores around the house, and I stopped micromanaging him about it. I've started losing weight. It seemed like things were well on their way to being like when we first got married. Now I've caught him doing this. Now I'm wondering if the whole reason he started making my smoothies wasn't actually a gesture to show he cares about me like our counselor talked about.\n\nI can't imagine facing him tonight. What do I say. What should I make of this. Why would he possibly think that's okay??\n\nTL;DR: I caught my husband masturbating into my smoothie this morning and suspect he's been doing it for weeks. He won't admit anything. We both left the house angry this morning. Guess I was wrong about marriage counseling being a success.

My BF and I originally decided the best thing to do would be to calm down, make a plan to move out and just go as soon as possible, but that didn't last long, and honestly at this point in time, I'm actually glad it went this way. \n\nOn his way home he became very irritated and snapped. He couldn't just let this act slide, so he didn't. He first texted the photo I sent him to his mom and asked what the deal was, and much to my surprise, she had NO idea what he was talking about. It was genuine, but at this point I just can't see her the same way, involved or not. He then asked his dad, and the answer in return made my heart sink, \"It's a night light.\"\n\nMy BF was furious. His dad tried to explain, but my BF was having none of it. He then asked me to see what was on the card because he was confronting him, no turning back now. Because I'm no good with phone technology, I had to wait for him to come help me. I stayed at a nearby friend's house until he was able to meet me there and help me review the footage.\n\nWhen we were able to see the videos, it was weird. There were quite a few, but most were about 5-10 minutes long, and they were only dated for three days, one being around the beginning of October, one mid october, and the other on the day I noticed it in the room. The very first video was of the kitchen, it almost seemed like he was testing the device. The next video was a few hours later and was in the room I occupied. This specific day we would have been home, but decided to go out, so not much was captured. The placement of the camera is very troubling because it was plugged in under the desk I use and into the outlet I use for my laptop. The mid day was the same way, but I was in my BF's room for the morning instead on that day.\n\nThe videos dated for the day I saw the device are even more troubling. It shows video of me walking around, gathering my stuff, laying out clothes, packing my bag, folding blankets, basically everything I did that morning. Then there's one last video, that one I'm worried about the most. But fortunately/unfortunately? The video file is corrupted and I cannot view it; I assume it became corrupted when I yanked the device out of the wall when I first noticed it.\n\nI didn't view the videos second for second, but instead just jumped around timestamps, but it's very obvious it was filming me, I was unware, and it was in seemingly secret spots. That was all my BF needed to see and know and from then he took off for his parents' house. I stayed and talked to my friend About the situation until he returned.\n\nFirst words out of my BF's mouth was that it's very evident that his dad is lying. He tried excuse after excuse, changed the story multiple times, kept repeating himself to make it sound good, etc. It started with: he bought it long ago, and forgot about it. Then he didn't remember buying it at all. Then he did remember buying it, but didn't know there was a camera. Then he claimed no, he found it in a drawer and thought it was a Night light. He thought to put it in the room for me so I wasn't super dark for me. \n\nNone of that makes sense to me. Its really hard to believe the most tech savvy person I've ever met wouldn't know what it was. It bothers me that he even bought one in the first place. If he did buy it long ago, was his plan for me? His wife? His daughter? Even his son? Its a spy camera, he obviously had some weird intent with it. Also, I doubt anyone would sell a night light without advertising that it comes with a camera and that the actual night light part doesn't work. Also, he put it in the room for me, despite me never complaining that it was too dark. There's the ceiling light, a lamp, and even my TV screen to help me see. And lastly, what I don't understand the most is why it was moved around so much if it was just a night light. It starts in the kitchen, then it's in the room. It had to have left the room several times because I've plugged and unplugged my laptop every single day and never have I seen it when doing so. Then it just magically appears in a different spot on a different day. If it's a Night light, why would you be using it 3 days out of the month and only for a few hours at a time, and, if I might add, when it's not even freaking dark out and mainly in the morning? It never shows being used while it's night or dark in the room. There's a night light in the hallway and in two bathrooms, and they have never moved once since I've been there.\n\nEventually after just being dumbfounded over the information I tried to collect myself and call my parents. They understood the circumstances and allowed us to go to my house and live there until we can sort out a new living situation. They were very understanding and even let my boyfriend stay because they didn't want him in that sort of unhealthy environment either. So from there I went home, and my BF went to his house to gather some belongings and then went to my house.\n\nI don't know how long we have here, my mom is helping out by trying to find some affordable places, but I don't know what we could afford and how it will work out. My BF right now is working on getting his own phone plan, medical insurance, and all that because he wants to just cut all ties with his family, save his sister and grandparents. He ended up telling his sister and she was just struck with disbelief and rendered speechless. He wanted to tell his whole extended family, even his dad's mother, but I don't know if he will. I understand why he wants to, but (and I know it's stupid) I don't want his family seeing it as my fault. I know it's not my fault at all, but I'm involved and I just feel like they'll always see it as that. Its also kind of embarrassing in a way, and I just don't want that kind of attention to it (by people I know, I mean.) \n\nContinuing on, Yesterday we stopped by his house to gather what we could of our stuff. Something broke on his car, so we had to use mine, which I was fine with. I just stayed in the driveway in My car while he went in and gathered what he could. I was okay with this, he didn't pressure me to go or anything. But we got what we could and what we needed and left and plan to make a few more trips to get the last of our stuff. It makes it difficult that his dad works from home, but whatever. Right now I'm starting to wonder if this is why he started working from home, because he only started doing it in late September. \n\nYesterday was alright. My BF spent a long time cheering me up and just distracting me, which I needed. Toward the night I realized it took a large toll on him too. He was very upset, and I did what I could to comfort him. He worries my parents hate him because he put me in that situation, but they don't think that at all. He's stressed about having to really be on his own and I don't think he's ready for it. We had Some stuff planned for the holidays but seems we can't really do that anymore, and tons of other stuff. I did remind him that while he is leaving his family, my family still loves him and will take him with open arms. \n\nAs for me, I'm just really lost. I feel like everything is surreal, and I'm in shock of some sort. Like I have calmed down since the panic from the situation, but I'm still in this weird disbelief stage where my head is just like \"It didn't happen, it never happened\" but yet, I saw the video, I have the card, we moved our stuff out and to my house... Its just weird and I don't know how to feel. I don't think I'm processing this properly, but I don't know how to do it right. Never in a million years did I think this would happen to me, and I just don't know what to do.  When I think about it, I get weird anxiety washing up over me. I find myself checking corners and outlets more, and it's weird because it's my own house, my own room, my own space that I know my parents haven't tampered with, but I still feel the need to check. I'm trying to just immediately push it into the past, but I still feel weird over the situation. I feel a million times better about being in my own house in my own room, with my BF beside me, but I still feel so paranoid.\n\nI wish I knew how to process and overcome this, but I'm not sure how.

I made a post a few days ago about my boyfriend needing space after I'd been assaulted. Just wanted to provide the update no one asked for haha.\n\n\n\nI spoke with my boyfriend. I explained everything how I've come to understand it, I cried, I was hopeful he would be on my side, especially when I told him it was not my fault and I had no control in the situation. I also reiterated that I love him, I have never wanted to cheat on him and that I want to fight through this with him.\n\nHe agrees that what happened was awful and says that he was never mad at me. He doesn't plan to talk to my assailant ever again. He also said he doesn't know how to trust me anymore, or anyone else for that matter. He says it's going to take him a long time to get over this, and he feels like in order to get over it, he needs me to not be around for a long time. \n\nWhen I asked what I did that earned his distrust, he said it was my actions in the situation. The actions I had no control over and no memory of due to my state.\n\nI asked if we were going on a hiatus or if it's just over. He says it's over. He said he wants me to take care of myself and he hopes I can be okay again.\n\nI told him the following:\n\nI have just been assaulted by someone I thought was a close friend, my trust has been shattered; I have dealt with this on my own for several days while you've had your space and time to think; I am now standing in a parking lot having my heart torn out by the man I wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with; my heart is in pieces. I am destroyed in this moment. I will get through this. I will be okay. And I will be okay with or without you.\n\n\nI'm hurting a lot right now, but I'm not going to let this hold me back. I'm better off without him, especially if he is hurt by my part in this and he is refusing to listen and understand that my part was entirely unwilling. I don't need someone who is going to put part of the blame on me when all of the blame should be on the person who assaulted me.\n\nThank you for the support and feedback I received on the original post.

Blindsided I agreed to let her continue. As far as I know she hasn\u2019t slept with him but they have sexted, and talk every day for at least 2 hours. He makes her feel like a teenager again. She admitted she has bought him gifts and contraband (the cellphone). He gets out at the end of December and she wants to see how they work out sexually. If it doesn\u2019t work she said she would stop, if it does she wants to keep it going. When I come home from work she is polite enough to hang up and wait until I\u2019m asleep to talk to him again. She is often aroused and wet after these phone calls.\nMeanwhile when I\u2019m around her I can hold it all together but when I\u2019m at work or alone I\u2019m constantly wondering what I did wrong. Last night I went through her phone while she slept and read her messages. She really does love him and has admitted that she couldn\u2019t wait for him to get out of the facility so they could make their relationship official. \nI don\u2019t know if I can keep this going on without finding an outlet to stop thinking of them. She offered us having an open marriage but I know I couldn\u2019t do that loving her the way I do. \n\nAny advice from people who have been in a similar situation but stayed with their partner?\nAnd if you left after trying to work it out, why?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2165229, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "She wants an open marriage", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572686140, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dq1ryz/she_wants_an_open_marriage/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwawaycraxkhead", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4x6vozgs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572598305, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dq1l3h/i27_found_out_that_my_boyfriend29_of_6_years_has/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dq1l3h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 164, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dq1l3h/i27_found_out_that_my_boyfriend29_of_6_years_has/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572598306, "score": 1131, "selftext": "I'm sorry if this is all over the place. \n\nAs the title says, my boyfriend has been putting crack in our weed. \nThis is a throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nWe have been together for 6 years.

I asked and he laughed and said it's something that makes the high better. \n\"Well, what the fuck is it?\" \nHe wouldn't answer, I assumed it was crystalized thc but he said no, and it didn't matter because I've been smoking it already anyway so it doesn't make any difference. \n\nI asked if it was cocaine and he said \"Yeah sometimes if we can afford it, crack is cheaper though.\"\n\n\nI have no idea what to do or say to something like that. \nHow do you decide to get someone addicted to a drug like this????

We had 3 children, but then in my 30s I got rectal cancer. \n\nAfter I was diagnosed with cancer, her whole personality changed. She became mean, emotionally abusive and verbally abusive. She actually said to me that she didn\u2019t want to be married to a cancer survivor and that she didn\u2019t want to sleep with me because of changes surgery made to my body (a colostomy and ED). \n\nShe made efforts to separate herself from the family by constantly seeking new careers that required intense training. She did eventually have an affair. \n\nWe divorced 5 years ago. \n\nWe remained civil in front of the kids. To be honest, during the years she kept changing her career goals, I was essentially a single dad. But once she moved in with her paramour, she began taking an interest in the kids again, and we were mostly in agreement on how to raise them. They lived with me, but we had joint custody. \n\nShe could be sweet as hell at public events. For example, at my son\u2019s little league games, she would act almost as if we had never gotten divorced. It prompted at least one mother who was having a problem with her husband to ask whether the secret to getting along was getting divorced. \n\nBut if it weren\u2019t for the fact that we had kids together, I would have cut her out of my life. I felt that betrayed and angry with her. I just did my best not to show it. \n\nHer new husband, however, is a sweet and compassionate man. He has always respected my role in raising my children, and never interfered. He turned out to be very generous and supportive of the kids. \n\nMeanwhile, ten years after my initial diagnosis, my cancer returned. The doctors thought I could just have surgery and that there\u2019d be a 6 week recovery. Instead, there were complications, and I spent 3 1/2 months in the hospital. Even after being discharged, I had medical issues and kept returning to the hospital about every month with infections. \n\nMy ex would bring the kids to see me in the hospital, but she was often barely sociable. When it became apparent that I was going to be hospitalized longer than anticipated and out of work, her husband decided to pay the mortgage on the family house where I lived with the kids. She resented that and on a few occasions tried to use the money to control me.\n\nBecause so much has been cut out of me, I have issues absorbing nutrients and electrolytes. I am on artificial nutrition and hydration. I  disabled. \n\nAt first, I lived in the family home with our kids. My oldest, who was in his early twenties, took care of me. But I lost significant weight. When I was practically a skeleton with skin, the ex and her husband offered to have me move into their house and have her take care of me since she did not work outside the house. Knowing I could not afford the mortgage on Social Security, I agreed. \n\nMy minor children and I moved into their home, and my adult son moved to an apartment (he doesn\u2019t get along with his mother). Then, another remarkable change happened. The ex became an angel with my care. Her whole attitude toward my illness changed. She took care of me extremely well, fed me and took me to my doctor appointments. \n\nNow here\u2019s my problem. A few months after moving in with my ex and her husband, I\u2019ve been having vivid sexual dreams involving my ex. They are so vivid, sometimes I wake up and I\u2019m uncomfortable being around her. I never tell her, of course.  And I respect her new husband too much to do or say anything about them. But these dreams continue. \n\nAt the moment, moving out is not an option because the complications after surgery make me totally dependent on her care.

I am in the process of finding a new place. He admitted to me the other night that he had his ex over while I was at work. So is whole family knows this but yet they smile in my face acting like nothing's wrong. Of course they would, of course they're going to cover for him. He says that she brought up getting back together but the important thing is that he chose me but to me it doesn't matter. I don't see why he would even have her at the house.\n\nThe way he talks about her, it's clear that he's not over. So I told him that if he thinks he would be happy with her than to go for it. If he feels that strongly about it then he needs to just go ahead and get back together with her. The thing is, she's with somebody too and I'm sure he wouldn't be too happy if he found out they were talking to each other because he can't stand my now ex.\n\nTo me that is the ultimate betrayal. Why the hell would you bring an ex over to the house that you share with your current partner unless you were doing something Shady? He claims nothing is going on between them but I don't believe him. He admitted to me that he talked to her while I was sitting right across from him. So I'm done.\n\n I'm moving on and I'm prepared to raise this baby on my own. Nothing good can come of me staying with him. He's made it clear that I do nothing but annoy him so I'm out. He says that I cut him off at the knees but he makes me feel the same way. He makes me feel like I can't be myself around him without him criticizing me. I know that that is the number one sign that someone is cheating or getting ready to is that they criticize everything you do.\n\nGod knows how long this has been going on between them. She couldn't stand me and made no effort to hide it. I don't care if he says he chose me, the fact is he still entertaining other women while he's with me. His Facebook friends list is 99% female. I deserve better than this and I will find somebody eventually regardless. He is trying to convince me that no one else will want me because I'm going to have a kid now. That's bullshit and we both know it. He's just trying to make me think I can't do better so I'll stay with him and he can continue to abuse me.\n\nThe worst part about it is that his family sees what he's doing to me and does nothing to help me. To me, if you see abuse happening and you don't do anything to interfere and try to stop it then you're as bad as the person who's doing the abuse.

Well here I am, my husband and I recently got married back in June, we've been together for about 4 years now. To everyone else, we are their favorite couple, bound to have beautiful children. We all know that there's so much more to a relationship than just love and babies. He was and has always been a gamer, his mom kind of used it to keep him and his siblings busy at home while she was out working or whatever. I grew up in a stricter household and only had the living room TV. When we first got together, I was pretty stoked about learning the Xbox and games. I thought okay this is pretty cool, no problem. It became a problem, when after our 1-2 hours of playing, he would continue to play for another 3-4 sometimes 5-6 hours. Now i don't know about yall, but I get bored of looking a screen after a couple hours. Even with our talks and discussions, he still plays an average of about 3-4 hours a day if not more. From the time I get home (he generally gets off an hour or around the time I get off) until after the food is done is when he'll finally hop off to eat and then hop back on.\n\nMy concern, as we've been together for a couple years now, isn't even that he's on there all the time, it's the face he can't control how long he plays for and doesn't give me or our pets time. My mindset is that we will have kids in a couple years, and he wants kids now, but I feel like if he can't get it under control now, how will he when we have kids. I worry about everything now, bills, housing, any kind of paperwork.\n\nI'm honestly emotionally drained from this and I'm ready to walk away for good.

Sorry if this is a bit long, I'm looking for advice and what people in similar situations have done. Thank you in advance! \n\nBasically, my boyfriend of about 4 years never responds if I send him something racy. I rarely do it but once in a while I feel like it's something fun and different, especially since he's often travelling and we're apart. Usually he'll ignore the message until I restart the convo, or he'll change the subject, or say something like \"thanks\". It makes me feel terrible about myself. With every other aspect of my life I have many other strong relationships (friends, siblings, colleagues etc)  I can turn to - but this is the one thing those other relationships can't give me (obviously). This has gone on for almost 4 years now. I've only been with two other guys before and they were all over me whenever I sent anything, so I guess I got used to that. Neither relationship worked out for other reasons but lately I've come to really miss the sexual chemistry I had with them, and I feel terribly guilty about that ... Plus I feel like I also maintain this idea of 'what guy wouldn't want to see his girlfriends tits!' \n\nHe recently went overseas again and before he left I casually asked  if I could send him something along those lines, and expressed that his responses in the past hurt me. He enthusiastically told me \"yeah send me something, I'm going to make more of an effort to reply better\" and even said what he would like to see.. I came away feeling like I was finally making progess. Fast forward to today. I sent him something in the morning and he didn't reply until the end of the day (fair enough, people aren't glued to their phones). He said \"thanks, I appreciate it\" and changed the subject. I gently said that I expected more of a response, made a joke about how that's something I'd say in a work email etc. Thought I was being chill even though inside I felt terrible. This was his response - \n\n\"I knew you'd say something like that.. I'm so fucking tired of the same conversation over and over. Does it ever stop? So what you sent me a pic, do you want a poem in response? I see you naked all the time. It's nothing special. I don't know why you expect gushing praise every time like I'm some guy off the internet\" and then \"Don't send me any more pics.  I don't need to be guilt tripped for failing to respond in a way that uplifts you all the time\".  \n\nTyping all of that out made me cry. Is it me? Is there something wrong with me?

Presently was at my parents house for Diwali, am really happy after what seems like a long time. Thought of updating the good internet people.\n\nSo basically I was an idiot, a big one. Made 2 mistakes. First one was to expect that the woman who didn't spoke against the harassment of her daughter is going to go home and confront her husband. She did nothing of that sorts. Not even told her husband that I confronted her (got to know this later). Second one was to take my wife to her hometown despite warning from kind strangers here on Reddit.\n\nLong story short, there was a confrontation, ugly one between me and FIL. I basically booked an earlier flight, fuck traditions, fuck ceremonies, and returned the same night the day we went. Can't go into much details. Only thing I feel bad is my wife's younger brother was there too, and I kinda dragged him also into this, for not protecting his sister. He didn't knew anything. He was the only person who apologised to me, and to his sister, for what happened. In heat of the moment I said some harsh words, like told him to not bring his wife to that household when he marries\n\nTaking advice from reddit, I played the family card. My wife is telling whosoever from her family is asking what happened is that her in laws do not want her to go to her hometown as relations between my parents and her parents are soured. And her mother is telling people that Damad Ji (Me) is angry with them, which I actually am. Her mother still calls my wife, almost daily now. She used to cry on the phone, that has stopped. Don't know if she talked to her father yet, as I'm at office during the day, if she did, she didn't told me. 1st week was worst. Things pretty much normal now. Everyone from family is thinking problem is dowry related, so nobody is asking too many questions. Everything is hush hush.\n\nAs for my wife, she refused to see a therapist, and I didn't insist on it. Have followups scheduled with gynae for next month, will see what happens. She is pissed/mad at me I guess for keeping her away from her family, but tries to hide it. I think this will wane away with time. She knows why I'm doing this. I won't let that man near my daughter, ever. Gotta do what you gotta do for your family. Had a really good last week with my parents. Wife is happy too. Indian festival of Chaath is starting in 2 days, so everyone is busy in that. Returning to my place after this week. Things would normalise after this I hope. First time in my life I understood the importance of festivals, it really really brings people together !\n\nHappy Diwali, and Happy Chaath !\n\nThanks for all your support", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2162560, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Update3] I am not letting my wife and my newborn go to her maternal home.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572588639, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpjhbv/update3_i_am_not_letting_my_wife_and_my_newborn/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SelectEmployer6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4u3rfiip", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572501151, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpjbnz/update_to_24f_i_feel_like_my_boyfriend_29m_is_too/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dpjbnz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 43, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpjbnz/update_to_24f_i_feel_like_my_boyfriend_29m_is_too/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572501153, "score": 1013, "selftext": "In my previous post, I talked about how my boyfriend would put me down all the time to make himself feel better, going as far as bringing up my past traumas and baiting me into situations where he could guilt trip me. So, here's an update;\n\nEveryone who commented told me I should have broken up with him and I was petrified by the thought, I'm not gonna lie. I was never really good with telling people how I felt, especially if it would affect them negatively since I'm very shy and, due to my past, the idea of making people upset scares me. It makes me feel dizzy and nauseated with fear, so when I'm in a relationship, I'm normally never the one to end things unless it gets dangerous. Thinking about the concept now even makes my heart race. So, you can probably see how I'm not well equip to lay one down on him. \nI was actually planning to just bottle it up and continue to entertain him, however the comments you all left me gave me a sense of clarity that I shouldn't deal with him in the way that I do. Plus, things got way worse. \nIt turned into a cycle; he would get in a bad mood (usually every night), call me, demand I drop everything to comfort him, drag my mood down to his level, use me until he felt better, then leave. (I would also like to point out that if I had an issue, he NEVER answered the phone, but I HAD to be there for him no matter the time or how little the situation).\nAfter he would shower me with compliments such as \"You're the only good thing in my life right now\" and so on. He also talked about marriage none stop, even taking me to shop for rings which was a HUGE red flag since we've been dating for a really short amount of time and even then, I did NOT want to spend the rest of my life with him. So, it was just a huge emotional Yo-Yo. \nI finally had to draw the line last night. I was really stressed with work. I had a huge project due and on top of that I was sick and just found out a family member had died. I was ready to snap and he knew this. But, I guess he was in one of his 'moods' again and needed me to comfort him. So, he calls again and starts to rant like there's no tomorrow. Didn't even ask how I was or say \"hi\". I listened to him for about an hour  (I don't remember what he was complaining about exactly as I wasn't listening most of the time, but it was very childish) before cutting him off and telling him that I had to go. \nHe got furious and called me a bunch of degrading names which got me very upset, so I told him how i didn't have time and was very tired (along with my current situation). He tells me he didn't need to 'hear all this BS' because his plate was full and I was being selfish if I thought my issues were greater than his and I should show him more respect. Especially if he was going to ask me to marry him in the future.\nThis was the last straw for me. There was no more flustering me with cute comments or backing me into a corner with insults. I gave him a reality check. I told him he was being childish,I wasn't his mother, and that I was leaving him. \nYes, support is important, but it goes both ways and it can't be toxic. Getting me as your girlfriend isn't a right. It's a privilege. Any relationship is a privilege, not a chore, job, or burden, and both parties should see it that way. \n\nNow, I can't say I enjoyed this. But, this experience gave me a good lesson. It showed me that I shouldn't let my fears be an excuse to let people treat me like garbage and I need to start dating people who look at me and value me as much as I value them. \nThanks to everyone here who gave me such good advice and helped me because lord knows, if I was left alone, I would have probably stayed with him longer.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2162534, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update to: (24/f) I feel like my boyfriend (29/m) is too dominating in some areas.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572587528, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpjbnz/update_to_24f_i_feel_like_my_boyfriend_29m_is_too/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sugarfreesharkfood", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13dd4n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572499479, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpj2wb/my_m25_fianc\u00e9e_f21_is_5_months_pregnant_and_its/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dpj2wb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 140, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpj2wb/my_m25_fianc\u00e9e_f21_is_5_months_pregnant_and_its/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572499480, "score": 106, "selftext": "Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. \n\nSo to start it all we go back to January. I started a new traveling contractor job. At the time the house we were living in was being put up for sale. Her and her daughter weren't able to come with me so they had to go home to her family house in Iowa.\n\nAfter living there for a couple of weeks she moved to her friends house where there was a 6 kids ranging from 6-22. They were really nasty and trashy people, bedbugs, trash, and maggots everywhere. \n\nEvery month for about 5 days I was able to go see her or fly her out to me. In May we were in Savannah Georgia and I proposed on the beach because she has never seen the ocean. That night we thought we made a baby. Well after seeing a specialist late 2018 I was told my chances of reproducing were approximately 2%. I thought I got lucky. The woman of my dreams and I were pregnant. We were extatic.\n\nIn early June I ran into a no contract and wasn't able to go see her. So it was a couple months that turned into 4.5 months. I was able to send her money for when she needed meds, or fuel, or parts for her car. I was getting sonograms of my child. I was happy I was doing everything I could to make sure my child was healthy.\n\nWell last month her car had a no start issue so I had it towed to the VW dealership about 100 miles from her and decided I was going to surprise her so I flew to des Moines yesterday morning. I got the car and drove it to see her. She was overwhelmed with joy.We went to get food, I took her to the store to get better fitting winter gear for her and her 3yo daughter. When we got to check out she went to the bathroom then messaged me after about 10 minutes that she threw up. I just thought it was dinner not sitting right since she's pregnant.\n\nThen she said we need to talk. We dropped her daughter off at a friend's house and went to the park nearby where she proceeded to tell me that my son wasn't mine but the eldest sibling of the place she lived at. I lost it, she was crying and apologized over and over again. I was furious for all of 20-30 seconds. But when I heard the pain and guilt in her voice I went back to her and held her I just wanted to take her pain away. I told her I forgive her and we can get through it all.\n\nShe got in her car and ran away, I walked about a mile back to her dad's house that we were staying at and she wasn't there. Whenever I tried to ask her to come home and we can deal with this issue she constantly told me no, she couldn't, she didn't want to see me and feel the pain anymore. I spent most of today (10/30/19) begging her to come home but she wouldn't.\n\nI called American Air and got a flight home for tomorrow morning and convinced her to at least let me see her before I left. I had her sister drive me to see her then to the airport. After I saw her, hugged her and reassured her I still loved her and left her a letter with how I felt. I left and proceeded to the airport. She blocked me on everything. From Facebook, IG, Snapchat, even cash app.\nShe would give me no answers.\n\nMy best friend gave me his fb info and I proceeded to contact her. I pretended to be him looking for answers as to why I was drinking at an airport in Iowa. She told \"him\" everything. She's staying here because she feels she deserves the punishment. I know I forgave her but she needs to forgive herself. She then said she blocked me to protect me because the people she was living with would hurt me if I ever came around. I was safer not talking to her.\n\nI still want her, I love her. But what route should I go with? I had my friend (me) tell her that I am gonna give her the space she wants but I'll always be at the ready for her to move in with me again. When and if she needed anythitg. She said she will find a way to contact me every few days and that shewanted to leave with me but she had to fix her life. I'm at an extreme loss, idk what to do, I'm not mad I just want my fianc\u00e9e back.\n\nWhat should I do? Do I hang on or do I just move on?

My girlfriend of 2 years and myself were going through a very rough time in our relationship. I lost a lot of my childhood best friends this summer and this put a toll on me mentally. I told my girlfriend that I was struggling during this time and I may not give her constant attention because i needed help. She didn\u2019t like this. I want to first off say that I was never a perfect boyfriend. I said many things in the past that I regret but she didn\u2019t care about my mental health during this stage. \n\nLast week was our worst fight ever. I felt like I was losing her. She told me that she still loved me and wanted to be with me. I respected that she needed space and gave it to her. She told me that I hurt her so many times and she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I knew that even though this fight wasn\u2019t my fault, if I didn\u2019t put my pride away I would have lost her for good. I loved this girl to death. I loved, protected, and cared for this girl for as long as I could remember. I eventually took the blame for everything. I told her that it was all my fault and i\u2019m willing to change and work to be better for her. She told me that she wanted me to prove it to her. \n\nFor a whole week I was hurting. I was trying so hard to win her back and love her. I just wanted to prove to her that I could be a wonderful boyfriend to her. She took advantage of this. While i was doing everything I could she was being rude to me and swearing at me constantly. Once again I soaked up all of it and said it was my fault. \n\nOn Friday my life changed. I was waiting for her to finish work so I could facetime her. I wanted to talk to her about our relationship and how we can do better. She told me she was getting food after work. When she answered she wasn\u2019t in her work clothes. It took me one hour but I finally got her to admit to me that she was with another guy. Straight to my face she told me she had sex with a guy from work. She had no remorse or guilt. Honestly this was the darkest night of my life.( I have a viral reddit post that talks about what happened after in detail.) \n\nShe told me that what she did was justifiable because I hurt her in the past. I asked her why she told me she loved me and wanted to be with me if she fucked another guy. Those were my last words to her. She made me try my heart out for a full week to \u201cwin her back\u201d and prove to her that i\u2019m a good guy when she went behind my back and got into a relationship with someone else. I have never been so humiliated and hurt in my life. I actually found out that she started talking to this guy ONE day after our big fight. I just want her to feel guilty but I don\u2019t think she ever will.

Very American issue here...\n\nTomorrow is Halloween and for the past couple years I've just started dreading the months of October-January. As soon as all the candy hits the stores, he's out loading up. Sure he eats candy throughout the rest of the year too but literally it's everywhere this time of year, he's surrounded by it and he's always got an excuse. \"Oh but it's a special flavor for Halloween. Oh this looked like something nice to try for Christmas. Oh come on it's the holidays, do you want me to be miserable or something?\"\n\nHe simply has no control. He buys a new pile of shit at least once a week. Not just candy either but full on bakery desserts meant to feed a whole extended family. He'll again have \"reasons.\" Like the cake was in the shape of a Thanksgiving turkey. Or the reindeer cookies looked cute. Or people would like it for Christmas dinner. Or times like Black Friday or the week after Halloween, \"but it's on sale!\" Behind all of this the real motive is he just wants to stuff himself with more junk food.\n\nI feel like he uses the holidays as an excuse to go hog wild with no concern to his health, because food is such a big part of everything. The cultural attitude is you're supposed to indulge and have a good time with other people. So he'll attend parties with me where he just stands at the snack table eating the whole time. He makes extra food at home, much more than we need, says it's for guests when guests aren't coming for another week and then eats it all with abandon. He has eaten the kids' Halloween candy which made them upset, and then what do you know, he's got the perfect opportunity to go get twice as much to 'replace' it.\n\nHe uses the kids as an excuse too. He'll say they were begging for something I know for a fact they don't like. He gets it because he wants it, not them. He'll say he's gotten snacks for my or his family but eats most of them before anyone else can have any. I dislike that he pretends he had other people in mind and wanted to do a nice thing for them, when it's obviously about himself. \n\nAs another example. I bought a few bags of assorted candies earlier this week for trick or treaters. They're nearly all gone now, and not by my kids.\n\nUnsurprisingly his weight is beyond the pale. He refuses to tell me precisely what the number is or else says he doesn't know. But, last I knew it was approaching 400 pounds. That was last year. So take that as you will.\n\nHe hasn't been to the doctor in about as long which would be fine for a healthy normal person but he is not the norm. Who knows what problems could be developing like a ticking time bomb inside him? He already has trouble breathing while asleep, and snores terribly. We had to get an extra large mattress because I was no longer able to fit comfortably. I often prefer to sleep on the couch still. He struggles with walking longer than the amount of movement needed to just get around the house. Which means he doesn't bother to take any walks that could help him get some exercise. He needs a seatbelt extender in his car. His job is completely sedentary, and it's an office which means his colleagues of course bring in lots of sweets to share around the holidays. So no help there. This is another way he rationalizes it, \"I'm baking a hundred brownies for everyone at work\", or \"the cupcakes are for a decorating competition at work!\" I'm lucky if half of those things even make it to the office.\n\nI guess this is kind of all over the place, so to sum up because some of you might be wondering what the problem is, these are my main concerns about the holiday gluttony:\n\n- Our budget and the waste of money\n\n- This obviously contributes to bad health\n\n- The shitty excuses.\n\n- Embarrassment around other people in social settings (his food consumption as well as his ballooning size over the past few years has been commented on)\n\n- Using people and gift giving to look considerate when really he's being selfish.\n\n- Kids constantly trying to eat the garbage he does\n\n- He's just going to get fatter. \n\nPlease help, how do I stop this before it really takes off this year? Planning and cooking and organizing and socializing is already tiring enough without him doing nothing but inhaling everything around him.\n\nTL;DR: Halloween to New Years is basically a non stop bingefest for my husband. On all types of sugary foods and overeating at nearly every meal. He claims he buys all this junk as gifts to share with other people, or that he's allowed to treat himself because of holiday traditions, but I'm really tired of the excuses.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2161818, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm (34F) dreading the holiday season because of how my obese husband (35M) of 8 years eats everything.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572571480, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpgevw/im_34f_dreading_the_holiday_season_because_of_how/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Throwra773", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wuuxcqq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572480507, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpfehc/my_31m_girlfriend_24f_is_hysterically_angry_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dpfehc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 56, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpfehc/my_31m_girlfriend_24f_is_hysterically_angry_i/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572480509, "score": 139, "selftext": "So I'm going to try and explain this as best I can without getting convoluted. My bestfriend (Ron, 34M) and I work at the same job and have for a couple of years now. In this time we made friends with a coworker named Jessica (obvious alias) who is 20 and when started working with us was viciously depressed. We all worked the same job and workeeddirectly together, so it's not like we sought out a girl a decade our junior to add to the roster. All of her friends had moved away to University or for work, and her boyfriend was an... interesting fellow. We also worked/work with him, and he's always been a nice guy to me, but I wouldn't date him either. It was readily apparent to everyone except her ex that he, was in fact, the problem. This is something Ron and I never brought up, and instead just treated her like every other friend we have which means a lot of Mario Kart and memes, primarily. I have never made any sort of sexual advances or flirtations with her, and to my knowledge, neither has Ron. We were just there to be the bros you need when your shit goes wrong, as bros do. Eventually she had a messy breakup with her ex, who blames Ron and I (amongst other things) for them breaking up. She chose the healthy friendships over the dysfunctional relationship and sent him packing. Which was great, until recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my girlfriend (26F) and I have been together for like 6 years now. 2 of those years were spent at a distance because of work situations and the fact that neither of us could take a massive pay cut to move. We spent every weekend together that we possibly could, holidays, whatever. She is only 3 hours away, so it wasn't the end of the world, but it sucked. Our relationship stayed strong for the most part throughout her time apart and now she is finally able to transfer back with a shiny new job, which should be a joyous thing, and it is but...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Cathy and I started dating, she had this unreasonable notion that I was some kind of massive player and lady's man, when I am really just closet weeb with a handsome face and streak of dumb luck once upon a time. I do not cheat, have never cheated, and will continue this way despite being cheated on before by other women. But ever since then she has been... aggressively opposed to me having female friends. She would often get moody or combative when I talked to other women, regardless of the topic, for no other reason than because they were female. And I don't mean on Insta or Tinder or anything seedy. I mean out in public, at parties full of friends, where most of these females were known persons to both of us or varying acquaintance. And I'm not a flirtatious guy, just a bit humorous. Hell, even my friends don't bring up stories of our female friends because she gets moody. But Cathy would throw a fit (sometimes publicly, mostly privately) because a woman dared approach me and I dare speak back to them. It's not like our relationship was a secret or anything. Every single girl I talked to knew who I was going home to. And still, it would be a minor to massive meltdown every single time over what amounted to stupid jokes and general \"so what's new?\" level of conversation. However, when she moved away, this problem moved with her, and I felt like I could breathe easier in social situations because I didn't have to walk on egg shells around the opposite sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to today when we have a massive fight about \"Who this Jessica girl is\" despite the fact that they have been introduced before and I have reminded her several times who this person is and how I know them. Now, Ron and I have a tradition of getting together at my place that has been ongoing for years (even before Cathy left) now where we watch wrestling after the late shift at my house. Jessica has recently been joining in because she too, enjoys wrestling. The evening usually consists of smoking weed and complaining about work while we watch buff dudes roll around on the mat for an hour or two. Jessica never comes without Ron being there, and I have never hung out with Jessica alone outside of work EVER. Ron has, and his wife could care less because she knows Jessica isn't a threat to their marriage in the slightest. She has come over and watched Star Trek at like 2AM while his wife slept and all she said the next day was \"That's nice, dear.\" My girlfriend, however, is currently half hysterical because I asked if Jessica could join us next week because why would I invite her and in a roundabout way implying I have intentions of infidelity when I absolutely do not. I know I have mentioned Jessica coming to watch wrestling before, and I know I have mentioned Ron is always there too, but now, for the millionth time, Cathy is claiming that she has no idea who this strange woman is coming to her house and she is flat out refusing to even talk about it.

Presently was at my parents house for Diwali, am really happy after what seems like a long time. Thought of updating the good internet people.  \n\nSo basically I was an idiot, a big one.  Made 2 mistakes. First one was to expect that the woman who didn't spoke against the harassment of her daughter is going to go home and confront her husband. She did nothing of that sorts. Not even told her husband that I confronted her (got to know this later). Second one was to take my wife to her hometown despite warning from kind strangers here on Reddit. \n\nLong story short, there was a confrontation, ugly one between me and FIL. I basically booked an earlier flight, fuck traditions, fuck ceremonies, and returned the same night the day we went. Can't go into much details. Only thing I feel bad is my wife's younger brother was there too, and I kinda dragged him also into this, for not protecting his sister. He didn't knew anything. He was the only person who apologised to me, and to his sister, for what happened. In heat of the moment I said some harsh words, like told him to not bring his wife to that household when he marries \n\nTaking advice from reddit, I played the family card. My wife is telling whosoever from her family is asking what happened is that her in laws do not want her to go to her hometown as relations between my parents and her parents are soured. And her mother is telling people that Damad Ji (Me) is angry with them, which I actually am.  Her mother still calls my wife, almost daily now. She used to cry on the phone, that has stopped. Don't know if she talked to her father yet, as I'm at office during the day, if she did, she didn't told me. 1st week was worst. Things pretty much normal now. Everyone from family is thinking problem is dowry related, so nobody is asking too many questions. Everything is hush hush.  \n\nAs for my wife, she refused to see a therapist, and I didn't insist on it. Have followups scheduled with gynae for next month, will see what happens. She is pissed/mad at me I guess for keeping her away from her family, but tries to hide it. I think this will wane away with time. She knows why I'm doing this. I won't let that man near my daughter, ever. Gotta do what you gotta do for your family. Had a really good last week with my parents. Wife is happy too. Indian festival of Chaath is starting in 2 days, so everyone is busy in that.  Returning to my place after this week. Things would normalise after this I hope. First time in my life I understood the importance of festivals, it really really brings people together !\n\nHappy Diwali, and Happy Chaath !\n\nThanks for all your support", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2160826, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Update2] I am not letting my wife and my newborn go to her maternal home.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572546521, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpanlt/update2_i_am_not_letting_my_wife_and_my_newborn/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwRA-7921675", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wsd9981", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572459544, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpaij3/boyfriend_30m_is_planning_on_cheating_on_me_26f/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dpaij3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 300, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpaij3/boyfriend_30m_is_planning_on_cheating_on_me_26f/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572459547, "score": 712, "selftext": "Things have been rocky with my [26F] boyfriend [30M] of 3 years for a while (fighting constantly, he has an alcohol problem, etc), but our love for each other has kept us together.

We pretty much do everything together, so neither of us is in the apartment alone usually. Because of this, I only get to masturbate maybe 1 or 2 times a week, which, I\u2019m not complaining about, but I do like to be able to pleasure myself more often even with sex. She generally needs more sleep than I do, so sometimes I will stay up past her bedtime. \n\nThe issue:\nLast night we had kind of a serious talk in bed right before sleep, resolved it, then snuggled to fall asleep. Neither of us were horny, and she was looking to go to sleep soon for her early work in the morning. I wasn\u2019t tired at all, so I got up to go play some games. After an hour of playing games, I got horny, but wasn\u2019t going to wake her up for work. In fact, I kind of did just want to beat one out real quick by myself, for convenience and ease. \n\nIn the morning, she was passive aggressive when getting ready for her work and when I asked why, she said it was because she felt \u201cuncomfortable with either of us masturbating when the other is available\u201d. Well first, she wasn\u2019t really available and second, sometimes I DO want to just masturbate by myself. She and I have sex 1-3 times a day, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m choosing to masturbate a majority of the time. I just want to be able to masturbate without her feeling offended that I didn\u2019t choose her instead.   She said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have minded you taking me if you needed to cum\u201d. Is there something wrong with me if I\u2019d occasionally rather masturbate than use sex to get off? Especially if I know the other person isn\u2019t \u201cin the mood\u201d and I\u2019m too tired to try and be sexy, but not tired enough to not masturbate lol\n\nThanks for the advice", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2160379, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Girlfriend (25) gets offended that I masturbate (25) when she is home", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572532660, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp7lzt/girlfriend_25_gets_offended_that_i_masturbate_25/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwaway09222017", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wqnuywm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572445210, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp7dlr/my_gf20f_has_mental_health_issues_and_has_cheated/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dp7dlr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 185, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp7dlr/my_gf20f_has_mental_health_issues_and_has_cheated/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572445211, "score": 165, "selftext": "Sorry for formatting, I\u2019m on mobile.

I love this girl, and after a failed past relationship that left me kind of broken, I put all of my faith and love into her. She has mental health issues, unfortunately, diagnosed depression and anxiety being the big two. I try to support her through everything however, the fact that she has some demons doesn\u2019t scare me. What does scare me, though, is the fact that when she gets in a depressed state, she doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore, including me. She tells me she just wants to feel again.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I found out that Belle made out with a guy we\u2019ll call A. I was devastated. I know it\u2019s not textbook cheating but I still felt betrayed. Then, two months later, it happened again. Same guy, different party. I told her I\u2019d give her another chance but she had to stop talking to the guy. Cut contact. She said fine, no problem, and we continued on. Fast forward to last night and everything is going ok. She\u2019s been having a rough time, but she\u2019s finally working through stuff in therapy, so I\u2019m hopeful for the future. I get on her laptop (to help her with a quiz) and her messages were opened up. And lo and behold, there\u2019s A\u2019s name. I read the messages (and they go back months, to around the times I told her to cut contact). She was going to football games to see him, sneaking behind my back to hang out with him. The texts were obviously flirtatious. I confronted her on them, and she didn\u2019t deny it, just told me that she\u2019s \u201cmessed up in the head and can\u2019t stop it\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do reddit.

I\u2019ll start with my brother who we will call Todd. He joined the military at 18 and just got out in this past year. He spent most of his military career over seas in Afghanistan or Iraq.  While he was gone, like any sister would, I missed my brother dearly and worried about him daily. When he told us he was leaving the Army and coming home my entire family was ecstatic. He\u2019s been home for about a year now, and things haven\u2019t been that great for him. He\u2019s staying with my mom, rarely leaving the house, and hasn\u2019t got a job. He is depressed and has recently expressed this to me even though I could already tell. He has always been a private, quiet person  and I didn\u2019t want him to be offended if I offered help. When he finally broke down to me, my girlfriend and I with arms wide open tried to help him the best we could.  Having gone through similar feelings with depression and anxiety I told him he needed to get out of the house, get a job, and start going to the gym.\n\nMy girlfriend has a step sister who was around the same age as Todd and single. We thought it\u2019d be a great idea to hook them up and get him out of the house for some human interaction and fresh air. We went on a double date and the 2 hit it off really well. I gave Todd a little bit of money to help pay for the date because I knew he didn\u2019t have money and wasn\u2019t working. A week later my brothers spirits are lifted and he is in a relationship with my girlfriends stepsister. I thought to myself that that was moving really fast but I know that he had felt really lonely for a long time so I didn\u2019t really blame him for wanting a connection with someone. Everything seemed to be going great, and I felt really good about helping him feel better. It hurt me to see my brother hurting. \n\nFast forward another week, I get a message from my brother. \u201cHey, can you check on Bethany (my gf\u2019s stepsister) she hasn\u2019t replied to me all day or yesterday night. \u201c Immediately a red flag goes up and I tell my girlfriend to call her. She gets no answer so she calls her father, and he says that she went to exes house last night. Wanting to protect my brother from any further hurt, I tell him to come over and just sit with us so I can tell him what\u2019s happening. He says something about we can watch Zombieland 2 that he downloaded on his external hard drive. I say bring it. He gets to our house and we reluctantly tell him what\u2019s going on and he\u2019s visibly upset. He cries and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen him cry. I cry. I\u2019m worried for my brother because I know he was already going through so much. \n\nWe make a couple drinks and decide to sit and watch the movie. He plugs the hard drive Into my Xbox and starts scrolling through files until he gets to Zombieland. As we\u2019re watching my brother is chugging alcohol. I tell him to stay and sleep on the couch and he agrees. My girlfriend and I head off to bed because we had to work very early the next morning. When we leave the next morning I give my brother a key to my apartment and tell him he can come crash here anytime he wants if he just wants to get away for a little bit. \n\nFast forward again and my gf and I come home from work and cook dinner and realize Todd has left the hard drive still plugged into the Xbox. He told us he had tons of new scary movies downloaded on it the night before so we decide we are going to find one to watch before going to bed. As we are scrolling through the files we see one that looks way too familiar. It\u2019s labeled (gf\u2019sname.pics). My gf and I look at each other and I already know what I\u2019m about to open. \n\nA couple of months prior my gf bought me a really nice camera for my birthday. The first thing I did was take sexy pictures of her with it in our bed. Mainly just messing around with the settings but also because well, I\u2019m in love with her and she has an amazing body. Halfway through taking these pictures she takes the camera from me and starts taking pictures of me as well. These are very intimate pictures meant for no one else\u2019s eyes. Nudes of both of us kissing. Laying. Snuggling. Bent over. I\u2019m sure you get the idea. After taking these I uploaded them to my laptop and deleted them from my SD card so nobody going through my camera could see them. I hid the folder away and honestly forgot about it. My brother a few weeks later offers to download Game of Thrones on our laptop so we can finish watching it. I bring my laptop to him and pick it up again a few days later. This is when I\u2019m assuming he downloaded the pictures of my gf onto his external hard drive. \n\nSo when we see this file on his hard drive we open it and it\u2019s just the nudes of my girlfriend and none of me (thank god because that would have made this so much worse especially since i am also a girl. ) but it still means he saw the nudes of me because he would\u2019ve have to pick and choose which pictures he wanted to download. My gf is immediately mortified. We are staring at her bent over on our 72 inch screen tv. I become furious.  And sad honestly.  I\u2019d been building a relationship with him that I didn\u2019t get to have for 10 years and then find this? \n\nI called my mom and asked what I should do about the situation and she is at a loss for words. If it were up to me I would never confront him about it and just distance my gf and I from him but I know that\u2019s probably not the right answer. I\u2019m so scared that if he gets confronted with this it\u2019s going to be the straw on the camels back and break him. I\u2019m afraid it will push him over the edge and he\u2019ll be embarrassed and do something terrifying. Here I am still trying to protect him when I know I shouldn\u2019t be. My gf wants to message him and confront him but I don\u2019t blame her. I told her we need to wait until we calm down to make any decisions. Reddit, what the hell do I do to keep a relationship with my brother? And is that even possible? I\u2019m so afraid that this is going to tear my family apart if brought to the surface. \n\n\nTL;DR  My gf and I found nudes of her on my brothers hard drive after he brought it over to watch movies on. I\u2019m scared to confront him with this because he\u2019s depressed and I think it will throw him over the edge.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2160208, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (22F) brother (29M) has naked pictures of my girlfriend (25F) on his external hard drive.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572526244, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp6aia/my_22f_brother_29m_has_naked_pictures_of_my/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwra294", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wpv4ibs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572437331, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp5tvm/i30f_am_scarred_by_hearing_so_much_about_my/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dp5tvm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1226, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp5tvm/i30f_am_scarred_by_hearing_so_much_about_my/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572437332, "score": 6398, "selftext": "Is it normal to have heard extensive details about your partners past lovers?

We just got engaged about a month ago (yay!) and have been together for a year and a few months, but this is an issue that concerns me for our future. For the majority of the time we have been together, sex has been an issue. She has a hard time with me initiating and usually turns me down. She has conveyed this is because sex for her isn't about love, it makes her feel trapped and like I want something from her. I've gotten to the point where I get severe anxiety about initiating and we have gone from having a lot of sex (like 5-6 times a week) to having sex sometimes just once a week. Even when we do, I usually feel anxious about it because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. There are also feelings of resentment for me around it now because it's always on her terms, I feel like when we do do it, she probably doesn't really want to, and also PARTLY because (and this may be horrible of me) I struggle with worrying that she might just be with me (a woman) because she has felt used by men. Even just with kissing she struggles. At one point we were kissing and she jerked back and practically screamed at me how much she hates kissing me. Almost immediately afterward she started saying she didn't mean it and trying to take it back, and I haven't heard it since, but still now when I kiss her I just feel like she's waiting for it to be over.

I just feel like for the sake of health it should stay clean. \n\nI think last week I cleaned up at least a months worth of needles and empty alcohol packs. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s hoarding tendencies. There\u2019s so many bags and boxes piled around from her mom and my gf doesn\u2019t have a good model to keep her from doing the same to her room. I\u2019ve talked to my friend about coming over to help scrub while they\u2019re away. I\u2019m worried if they come home to a cleaner house her mom will freak about me moving things. I don\u2019t plan to trash their items. Everything just needs a good scrub and maybe a drawer to finally call home. \n\nI think it could be a nice surprise. Should I flat out ask my gf?  Make a joke like \u2018good thing you left everything in my care I clean up my clients homes very well each time. I\u2019ll give you guys the free special\u2019. (I\u2019m a full time dog sitter so honestly I\u2019ve actually seen worse but this place is almost my second home too) She has a friend coming to take care of the cat and dogs also so maybe I should ask her? They\u2019ve been friends for ages. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s offensive to tell her friend I feel like their home is so dirty I should clean it and maybe she will text my gf and my gf will text me saying ..\u2019 don\u2019t do that\u2019\n\nI\u2019m pretty overwhelmed and I know I\u2019m over thinking too. I overthink everything and my girlfriend is so sweet and let\u2019s me ponder about endless scenarios for any situation. She\u2019s so sweet and good to me. Would this be overstepping ?\nThank you for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2160057, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it rude to clean someone\u2019s house without permission", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572518155, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp4xoo/is_it_rude_to_clean_someones_house_without/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MeJuul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4kdk5og2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572425051, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3zt8/my_23m_girlfriend_25f_allowed_a_guy_to_sleep_at/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dp3zt8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 458, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3zt8/my_23m_girlfriend_25f_allowed_a_guy_to_sleep_at/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572425052, "score": 920, "selftext": "So background, I've been dating this girl Monica for almost 6 months now. We met on a dating app and hit it off really well on the first date. Fast forward a couple months and we're official. Then another couple and we were in love.\n\nUnfortunately as we got to know each other better I found out she has a drinking problem. She'd get black out drunk every now and then and eventually it got to the point where I was in a position to witness the kind of person she was when severely intoxicated and I despised it. The lack of consideration towards the people around her, the emotional mess she became, and the inability to communicate with her rationally got to me. We talked and  she said she'd work on it and I had the time ust to believe she would. Although I believe she really has gotten better, a certain incident recently made me less hopeful of that.\n\nA couple weeks ago Monica had a brunch with close friend (we'll call her Rebecca), her boyfriend Tom (another good friend of my gf's), and the rest of Rebecca's friends. They were all drinking since then, throughout the day, and eventually evening came and Rebecca, Rebecca's best friend (let's call him Francisco),  Tom, and my girlfriend Monica decided to continue the party at her place.\n\nSoon after they arrived, my girlfriend allowed her best friend Rebecca and her boyfriend Tom to use the bedroom to have sex while she and Francisco just hung out in her living room. \n\nFrancisco then began flirting with my girlfriend Monica, even though she had mentioned me in conversation multiple times throughout the day. He even saw a picture of us on her phone and proceeded to continue to flirt with her. I was told there was at least 5 attempts after the fact that he knew Monica was in a relationship.\n\nSo Monica texts me and says she's getting uncomfortable with this guy Francisco that she just met because he's been hitting on her this whole time her friends are having sex.\n\nI freaked out and got upset because I believe hitting on someone you know is in a committed relationship is an incredibly shitty thing to do. I couldn't understand how Francisco could be so rude and disrespectful to his best friend's close friend,  my girlfriend Monica. \n\nI blew up and told her she should kick Francisco out for blatantly disrespecting her and our relationship in her own home, among close friends. \n\nShe felt that she was handling the situation by talking to Rebecca and Tom and getting Rebecca to talk to him in private about how disrespectful it was to hit on her multiple times while knowing she was in a relationship. After their talk my girlfriend  said Francisco backed off and promptly passed out on her couch while my girlfriend, Rebecca, and Tom continued to enjoy their night.\n\nWhen she told me that I was not happy. I felt as though my girlfriend and her friends did not see the magnitude of disrespect and malice Francisco had displayed. He knew Monica was in a committed relationship with me and still proceeded to hit on her. And somehow they all thought it was okay for him to continue staying there with them, and even sleeping on my girlfriend's couch with the intention of letting him stay the night.\n\nI have so many issues with this but I'd like to see a different perspective because it seems as though I'm the only person in this situation who thought it was wrong of Monica, Tom, and Rebecca to allow Francisco to sleep in her house after the degree of disrespect he showed to my girlfriend and our relationship, as well as the disrespect he showed towards his best friend Rebecca by hitting on her close friend Monica, my girlfriend. Monica eventually kicked him out only after we argued and she saw how upset I was which cause her to cry and have Tom take the guy home.\n\nI'm wondering if I overreacted by expecting my girlfriend and her friends to kick him out after he displayed such lack of empathy because it seems that she nor her friends wanted to take any action besides giving him a slap on the wrist and letting him sleep on her couch. \n\nI feel like I'm crazy for thinking it was wrong of Monica to allow this guy Francisco to sleep on her couch with the intention of letting him stay the night after he intentionally tried to get her to cheat on me with him. And I'm also upset at her friends Tom and Rebecca for not removing Francisco from situation even though they knew what he had done as well.\n\nNow we're still having arguments about that situation because I can't get over how everybody downplaying the severity of the situation and sympathized with the asshole who tried to get my girlfriend to cheat. Any input is appreciated, thank you.\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend hangs out with her friends and a friend of theirs. This guy proceeds to hit on her several times even though he knows my gf is in a committed relationship. Gf's friends talk to him and they all agree to allow him to stay the night sleeping on her couch. I'm unsure on how to feel about this, but I know I'm upset at everyone involved and I don't know if that's fair.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2159961, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [23M] girlfriend [25F] allowed a guy to sleep at her house after he tried to get her to cheat on me.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572511421, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3zt8/my_23m_girlfriend_25f_allowed_a_guy_to_sleep_at/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bambinash", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4tvi4kxc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572423182, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3ram/whos_been_married_for_a_long_period_of_time_10/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dp3ram", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 306, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3ram/whos_been_married_for_a_long_period_of_time_10/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572423184, "score": 1043, "selftext": "You look at them and can\u2019t imagine your life without them, soulmate, truly madly and deeply love type stuff.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2159933, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Who\u2019s been married for a long period of time (10+) and actually stayed madly in love with their spouse?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572509557, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3ram/whos_been_married_for_a_long_period_of_time_10/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwaway51515155151", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wlj0oke", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572422235, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3n14/my_18m_boss_50f_threatened_to_fire_me_if_i_dont/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dp3n14", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 146, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp3n14/my_18m_boss_50f_threatened_to_fire_me_if_i_dont/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572422236, "score": 253, "selftext": "My [18M] boss [50F] threatened to fire me if I don\u2019t keep sleeping with her after I got a new girlfriend.\n\nI\u2019ve had this job for 2 years already and i have progressed so much here.

I put up with a lot of stuff that I wouldn't let anyone get away with simply because I saw that the mom was working and actively saving to move. Looking for somewhere to stay and all.\n\nThey would leave bloody, pissy, poopy underwear on the floor. Piss and poop on the toilet. Sneaking food and leaving it out. There was polish and gum on my brand new furniture. I just tolerated it and told myself to be patient. \n\nYes, I know I shouldn't have put up with it or had them here in the first place honestly but I was just trying to help.\n\nUntil today. I have 3 jars of change in my room that belongs to my son. In ONE jar was $24 of change. When I went to borrow a dollar, I counted and realized that it was only 3.75 in there. They also cleaned the other jar out and left only pennies. \n\n\nYesterday I went to visit my dad's grave, it's a high stress time for me so obviously I'm super pissed about it. I asked the kids and they immediately began to blame each other. Apparently when I left yesterday they came into my room and stole all of the money. I only recovered $15 of it. \nI immediately made them pack their stuff and leave. And i feel bad for the mom because she truly has been trying to control them but I can't take anymore.\n\nI literally raised money for them to get brand new coats, gloves and scarves. I'm the one that cooks and does laundry. I'm the wrong person to steal from and I just don't understand. \n\n\nThere is a sense of relief by having them gone but I feel like a huge (b word).\nIt's cold here and I'm not sure where they are going but it's not my problem but I can't help but be concerned. \n\nI also broke up with my boyfriend but he's on the lease so he'll be here for 30 more days. I realized him and his sister was constantly making *me* be the bad guy and I was the only one complaining. Also, he waited until I went to sleep to say \"I'm going to pick up (sister).\" When I told him not to bring her back here, he slammed the door and left. \n\nA few hours later he comes back with her and her children in tow and basically told me she's a legal tenant as he is, and she has 30 days to vacate. Which I suppose is true but why would anyone want to be where they aren't wanted? \n\nI usually have her kids from 3-6:30 every day, except yesterday I left them home for an hour to go to the cemetery which is when the money was stolen.\n\nEven their mom, who put her and her kids out tried to guilt trip me into letting them stay because it's cold. Saying it's not their fault, when it actually IS. These aren't small children who don't know right from wrong. \n\nThey are 14, 13, 12, 10, 9. \n\nI told them that I will call the non emergency line to file a report about the theft of my stuff and now they're mad and their mom is constantly calling me. I really don't know what to do? How do I handle this?\n\n\nAlso, since they've been here I have a *serious* roach infestation and when they left I decided to clean so I could spray some more and found dirty underwear under the couch and a pile of food inside of the couch. \n\nIf you read this, thank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2159847, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I THOUGHT I got rid of my nasty houseguest", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572504496, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp33b9/i_thought_i_got_rid_of_my_nasty_houseguest/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DIDODETTAN", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uixifm4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572407080, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp1gz1/ex_boyfriends_girlfriend_reached_out_to_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dp1gz1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 51, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp1gz1/ex_boyfriends_girlfriend_reached_out_to_me/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572407081, "score": 376, "selftext": "\n....well now she's an EX girlfriend of his.\n\nIt all began with us being in love, getting into a relationship together and all that shit.

Which is partially why this is so strange for me and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nA couple months ago he started doing this thing where, when I yawn, he puts his mouth to my mouth and inhales the yawn that I exhale. He refers to it as me \u201cgiving him my yawns\u201d. This was cute and funny the first few times mostly cause it\u2019s so random and silly.\n\nExcept it\u2019s NOT a joke. After a while he started getting upset, almost offended, when I would yawn and not let him \u201ctake my yawn\u201d. I seriously thought he was just being silly. If I yawned and covered my mouth, turned away, he would get this hurt look on his face and ask me if I was \u201chiding\u201d my yawn from him. I explained to him that while I think it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s distracting when I\u2019m yawning and his mouth comes out of fucking nowhere like a carp leaping out of water and is suddenly on my mouth. Then I stop mid-yawn and can\u2019t get a satisfying yawn in and have to wait a few seconds and try to yawn again uninterrupted. It\u2019s like when you have to sneeze and then you just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not a good feeling. I explained all of this to him and he just doesn\u2019t get it.

Anyways, today was my day off and my husband had to leave for work at 8am so I was making him lunch. My sister then comes downstairs and asked me to make some coffee for her so I said told her, to give me a couple minutes so I could finish this for my husband or she could do it herself. And her response just pissed me off, she started telling me that he\u2019s a grown man and doesn\u2019t need his wife to be doing these stuff for him, because I\u2019m not his slave and a good sister wouldn\u2019t put a man before her sister. \n\nI was just so annoyed by that, for a lot of reasons. Like yes my husband is a grown man and can do all these stuff by himself and if I didn\u2019t do it, then he would have went ahead and did it for himself. But he\u2019s my husband and we\u2019re in a partnership and we share everything so not because he can do something himself means that I\u2019m gonna leave him on his own. A lot of times I have to be at work at 7am and I can barely wake up to my alarm. But he gets me out of bed, makes me breakfast and help me with whatever is needed even when he has to leave for work in an hour or he worked a late shift so he has little sleep. He\u2019s a cop and I\u2019m a nurse so our shifts can be all over the place. So we help each other out, he always prepares my clothes for me the night before even if he just get out of work, if I\u2019m coming home late he always makes sure I have a meal I\u2019m coming home to. And I do the same for him, and I love giving him back massages, so to have him criticize my marriage like that just made me so upset. We\u2019re in a marriage where we both help each other out, whenever and wherever we can. And I love going out of my way to make my man happy and just how grateful he is of everything makes me want to do it again.  \n\nBut she on the other hand is honestly very selfish.  She\u2019s my sister and I love her to death but she only cares about herself and that\u2019s why she\u2019s getting a divorce. Her husband\u2019s a truck driver who did his best to satisfy her and she was never grateful and tried to reciprocate. I remember one night he worked a 16 hour shift, and he came home to her eating a meal that she cooked and didn\u2019t prepare any for him. Like I would be so upset if my husband did that. No matter what, if we\u2019re going through the biggest fight or everything\u2019s fine during our relationship, if I get home first and he\u2019s coming home from work later I\u2019ll make sure he has something to eat and I most definitely wouldn\u2019t eat a meal and not get anything for him. And there\u2019s plenty of things like that and that\u2019s why she\u2019s getting a divorce. She had a great man but wasn\u2019t a great wife. And I\u2019m here trying to be a great wife and she\u2019s criticizing me for making my husband lunch I got so pissed and looked her in the eye and said \u201cthat\u2019s why I\u2019m still happily married and you\u2019re getting a divorce\u201d. \n\nAnd the part about a good sister wouldn\u2019t put a man before her sister was uncalled for. First off he\u2019s not some man, he\u2019s my husband who I made a commitment to, so he\u2019s gonna be the most important person in my life along with our kids. No matter what. And I wasn\u2019t even putting him above her, he had to leave for work in a couple minutes so I was trying to get it done for him, while she had nothing going on. She could have done it herself or wait five minutes. I\u2019m still so pissed at her. \n\nBut at the same time I know it was a shitty thing to say to my sister and watch her cry and I also feel really bad.

I have 3 nieces (11, 7, and 1) on my side between two brothers, and my husband has a niece on the way. We do well enough financially that we can, on occasion, treat our older nieces (11 and 7, one from each brother) to outings, moderately expensive gifts for birthdays and Christmas, etc. We enjoy spending time with them and like being the \"cool aunt and uncle.\" \n\nThe problem we are having now has to do with adding in my brother's girlfriend's children to the family dynamic. My brother and \"Sally\" have been together for at least a year (not sure exactly how long as he didn't let on for a long time that he was seeing anyone). Sally has 3 young kids of her own (8M, 7F, and 3F). I don't know too many specifics, but Sally and her kids have had a hard life. Think abusive/manipulative parents, abusive spouse, poverty, etc. My parents recently offered their home to Sally and her kids (my brother and my niece (7) have been living with them for several years after he was recovering from some health problems and getting back on his feet financially) so that they could save up for their own place, be closer together, etc. This has been a huge adjustment for all involved but especially Sally's kids and my niece (7). Our families are now very enmeshed; Sally's kids have been calling my parent's Grandma and Grandpa for a while now, so aside from my brother and Sally being legally married we're essentially all one big family. \n\nMy husband and I just don't know how to continue the dynamic we've had with our biological nieces and Sally's kids. We enjoy spoiling our nieces on occasion, but we can't afford to equally spoil Sally's kids. We really don't want to do anything that makes them feel left out or could lead to any resentment or jealousy at their age. We were inviting the 11 and 7 year old nieces to our house a weekend every month or two to spend the night and hang out with us, but I don't know that we can do that anymore without Sally's older kids feeling left out. Sally's oldest (8M) has autism, and the middle child (7F) is prone to severe outbursts and tantrums. My 7yo niece and Sally's 7yo are currently sharing a room and it's been very hard on my niece adjusting to no longer being an only child. My mom has discouraged my suggestion to have my 7yo and 11yo nieces over to give the 7yo a break, thinking it would upset Sally's 7yo. Honestly, I don't think my husband and I are equipped to deal with their needs if we were to try and have them all over at our house especially when they're all under so much stress right now.  We've also started to question how to handle things we had planned to do in the future such as: college funds for all the kids, helping them out with their first car, or taking them on trips. I especially hate that we can't do all these things for our nieces and Sally's kids because I feel that it just emphasizes that they've been victims of their circumstances their whole lives. Like these are the type of kids that probably need that extra helping hand more than most (My family as a whole is lower to middle class, and my husband and I are only more well off because we don't have children of our own.)\n\nDo we continue to treat our nieces the same way we have been, but do it more \"behind the scenes\" to avoid hurt feelings? Do we stop affording our nieces special treatment in favor of more equitable treatment? Have any of you been the kids or the parents in these situations? How did you adjust?\n\nWe realize there's always the chance things might not work out between my brother and Sally and it might be too soon to worry about some of the more distant questions, but with the holidays coming up, at the very least, we need to figure out how to navigate Christmas presents for the kids. For example, before Sally moved in, we were planning to get my niece (7) a Switch Lite (the 11yo niece got a Switch last year), but now we're thinking of just doing a full Switch for 'all of the kids' living at my parent's house. Should we take all of the small expenses we would have used for our nieces over a year and pool them into some bigger expense for all of them? In the end, we don't want to be the source of any hurt feelings on either side.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2158862, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Husband (28M) and I (28F) are unsure how to continue \"Cool Aunt and Uncle\" dynamic with new kids added to the mix", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572474014, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/doxbpi/husband_28m_and_i_28f_are_unsure_how_to_continue/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Zurthrow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9j9b5sv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572385483, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dowtke/does_me_f24_regularly_sleeping_naked_reduce_my/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dowtke", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 167, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dowtke/does_me_f24_regularly_sleeping_naked_reduce_my/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572385486, "score": 343, "selftext": "For the past several years I have always slept naked unless I'm at a friends house or something.

I'm not sure if I was really even \"assaulted.\" I don't know what to call it. Anyway here's some background. I'm a 23 year old guy and have been dating my 23 year old girlfriend, K, for almost 5 years. We have a strong and highly communicative relationship and we've powered our way through multiple summers of long distance during college, and most recently an almost 10 month long distance stint.\n\nIn spring of 2018, after months of open discussion and a few group sex experiences, we decided that our relationship had no reason to be based on sexual exclusivity. I'm not a big labels guy, but we then entered an open relationship. That summer we were again long distance and K ended up having sex with a few different people. She didn't tell me until the end of the summer and that fucked me up pretty good. We moved past it and realized that we needed to lay out some solid ground rules: \n\n- open and honest communication about having sex with others\n- no exclusive relationships with others\n- use protection\n\nPretty simple. We should have laid that all out right away, but we moved on. In January of this year K took a 10 month overseas job. At this point in our relationship it was a no brainer that we were going to stick it out. So we decided to stay together, open as before.\n\nThen it was my turn to fuck up. This spring I met a girl on tinder and we ended up having sex a few times. We had unprotected sex some of those times. It's highly out of character for me to be so dishonest and after a while I fessed up to K. I was lucky enough to be forgiven despite breaking a very explicit rule and I'm eternally grateful for that.\n\nDuring K's time abroad she's had a tough time dealing with her own mental health and in fact was sexually assaulted while staying at a hostel on holiday. I've had my own shit to deal with (deaths mostly) but we've been as supportive as possible over text and our occasional calls. However, providing emotional labor over the phone is kind of like walking in sand. You have to put in a lot of effort in order to make very little progress. For this reason and for the fact that K has to take care of herself I haven't been comfortable telling her about this incident. SO enough background.\n\nThis summer I was living and working with a bunch of really excellent people whom I love. I had sex with one of these people, M, a couple of times in July and August. In late August, we once again had sex. She knew very well about my relationship and about the rules. Despite this, as I was grabbing a condom she put my penis inside her as I told her to wait and to stop. I immediately pushed her off me. I was upset, but the gravity of what she had just done didn't register right away. The next morning I went on a three day work trip right away and had no chance to talk with her about what happened. I work in outdoor guiding and ended up having a pretty traumatic weekend in which an accident occurred where I was lucky to escape alive. So double trauma. \n\nThen, the morning after I returned from the trip, M died in a car accident. She died in a fucking car accident. This was an absolutely huge event in our little, tight knit community. Triple trauma. I was simultaneously mourning the death of a friend whom I cared very deeply about and trying to deal privately with the fact that she had violated my sexual consent days before. Obviously I couldn't talk to any of my friends/coworkers about what had happened between M and I. She was dead. That was a far bigger travesty than what had happened to me and I figured it was disrespectful for me to mention it to anyone. I still don't feel like I can talk to anyone who knew M, or who understood the context of our relationship/community about what happened. And as I mentioned above I can't talk to K about it because she's still overseas, was fairly recently assaulted herself, and I don't want to put anything heavy on her until we are back together.\n\nK's position is over and I'm going to visit in two weeks and travel with her for over a month. Needless to say, we have a lot of catching up to do and a lot of emotional shit to resolve that we simply could not resolve over the phone. But I'm hesitant to even bring the incident up. I'm afraid of hurting her again. I'm afraid of bringing focus away from the much more serious assault she experienced. I'm afraid that she'll consider my silence on the subject to be another dishonesty on my part.\n\nLast night I had a major breakdown about the incident, the near death experience, and the death of M. It all occurred within a span of 4 or 5 days and I have not been able to fully process the total mindfuck of a week that was. I realized last night that I need to seek professional help soon, probably before I leave to visit K. So my questions for you wonderful people are these: How do I go about telling K? Should I wait until we are back in the states together?\n\nSecond, if this is an appropriate question: what kind of professional can help me deal with the trauma of having my consent violated, almost dying, and having my friend die in a week? I feel like this spans a few different areas and I've never sought psychological counseling so I have no idea where to begin.\n\nSorry if this was a disjointed post. I wasn't sure how to organize all the layers of fucked that I am right now.

I lived across the country in Florida and agreed to move over to Minnesota just to be with her, because we always had a strong love connection but because of distance we never dated. \n\nWe started officially dating in June, but the next month she said she was going to New York to visit family for the weekend. That weekend she was being super shady, not replying to texts, posting snaps and never replying. She said she just doesn\u2019t reply or look at her phone when on vacation that much and to trust her. \n\nThis weekend we were drunk at her parents and I slept in the guest bedroom and she slept in her room upstairs. She accidentally left her phone unlocked in my room and since I was drunk I wasn\u2019t thinking right and I looked through her phone....\n\nI found out during the New York trip one month after we started dating that she went over to her distant cousins house and they had sex, I saw messages from another guy telling her how tight she was and that he misses cuddling with her. They talked flirty all the way up until the end of September where things cut off. Maybe she realized she had a conscience and she would start ignoring his messages more and being short, so I think she realized what she was doing was wrong and stopped it. The point is still that she cheated on me in the beginning of our relationship and never told me. Now she\u2019s going to New York again next week and I remember a message from last month saying she was going to sleep over by him again. So now I\u2019m thinking she\u2019s going to go there and maybe do it again, but that was a month ago. Her texts now to him are cut off or ignored like she had a change of heart.\n\nI really love this girl, we had a baby together (misscarriage) so didnt happen, but we gained a bond like no other for each other. She\u2019s always said if I looked through her phone that it\u2019s a sign of distrust which is all she has, and she won\u2019t tolerate it. But if I didn\u2019t look through her phone I wouldn\u2019t of found out.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should confront her about it or leave it alone and forget it since she might\u2019ve cut him off after realizing she was wrong. It was a month after we started dating and I feel like she loves me a lot more now not to do it again, but I\u2019m not sure. What should I do? We\u2019re really serious I met all her family and aunts and uncles, she posts me on social media, she\u2019s usually always hanging out with me, but I can\u2019t get the thought of her cheating out my mind. \n\nTLDR; My serious gf cheated on me in the first month of our relationship with her cousin. 4 months later i looked through her phone and found this out.

I want to thank everyone who offered real advice and support.  I am very appreciative of having some objective voices weigh in. \n\nI did what everyone encouraged me to do and hauled my butt to therapy.  I shopped for therapists and found a really stellar one.  He is compassionate, attentive and clear.  I also got involved in ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics), which has been helpful for me. \n\nMy response for a long while was just to hunker down. \n\nMy sister decided she did not want to speak about this topic with me, so we have distant. \n\nMy dad and I went almost 3 months without speaking.  He would text inquiring or asking to meet, and then cancel our meetings. \n\nI have avoided speaking with my stepmom all together. \n\nMy fiance and I have gotten closer through this experience.  I have leaned on him and he has been really supportive.  We are doing joint therapy to work on making sure this does not affect the level of trust and safety we can have as we move into marriage. \n\nEmotionally, I have not been too well.  This experience called a narrative and history into question.  The shift that has taken place has been sobering and disheartening, but it also feels like a lot of who I am and my makeup has kind of clicked into view. I have that, among many other things, to be grateful for. \n\nAll this hard stuff has led to some answers, even if they aren't the ones I wanted. \n\nMy Dad and I finally spoke on Saturday.  It went precisely as I could have imagined.  Probably, about as precisely as many of the commenters warned it would go, honestly.  I went back this morning and reread a lot of the comments before writing this and was shocked by how right everyone was...  \n\nBottom line:  Dad has doubled down on \"Nothing Happened Here\"\n\nDuring our call, he said he did not want to talk about any of this but then went on to say how much I am to blame for the bulk of it.  He said he has always felt in the middle of our \"battles.\"  I truly didn't understand this. I have always felt incredibly passive with my stepmom and rarely did anything to defy her.  When I questioned this, he said, \"you always said things - like \"you aren't my mom, don't tell me what to do.\"  I told him I had no recollection of ever saying this.  He said it was when I was 4.  \"You had it out for her from the beginning\". \n\nThe call was confounding.  He told me that maybe he should have not tried to stay in my life and just done what his dad had done and walk away.  He said this might have been better for me and part of him wishes now that he had just left and started a new family.   He said it probably would have been better for everyone if he had done it this way. \n\nHe made references to me being like my mom.  He said I always liked her more because of all the drama. He said this was me just bringing up more drama.  I stopped trying to explain any bit of myself during the call and went quiet.  There was blame, gaslighting, denial, hostility, passive aggression, all of it. \n\nThe odd thing about all of it was despite him offering no validation of what did happen or is happening now, I feel validated.  In my gut, I knew that was the way it would go.  At least I know why I didn't ever stand up for myself. There was never much room to...  I told him at least this much, that I knew this was the response he would give.  Didn't expect to hear him say he wished he had just walked away, but there it was. \n\nHe sees me as the problem child and my feeling of being the scapegoat here was presented in clear view.  Maddening, a little, because I never even talked back as a kid. \n\nAll in all, I am thinking this is one I just let go of and step back entirely.  I could not have imagined ever stepping away from family, but it does feel like the sanest thing to do. \n\nI will continue to focus on healing, on therapy, on figuring out this business of trust.\n\nThanks again.\n\nBest to you. \n\nTLDR - The internet weighed in, a lot of you with experience in this arena were correct... This isn't something we are going to come back from, but there is a light at the end of all it, regardless.

There is a super long history here which I will attempt to break down. \n\nBackstory:\n\n My ex-wife and I divorced 8 years ago.   We went through a gnarly divorce in which she remarried pretty soon after to a guy in the army.  She sent me a letter saying they were moving to Germany together and I'd never see my daughter again on a regular basis. I live in Atlanta, Ga. I filed a change of custody petition and had her served and the next day she served with a TPO saying I was sexually abusing my daughter.  This case went on for 2 years before we got in front of a judge who said if he heard our case he was going to take my daughter away from both of us. During those 2 years there was a ton of doctor shopping on my exwife's side (6 general doctors, 3 different DEFAC's doctors). During the first few months of the TPO the judge allowed me to keep my visitation schedule of every weekend but to be supervised by my parents.  I took lie detector tests, saw specialists myself, enrolled my daughter in therapy - something my ex never did. Anyways it was a loooong time of it just being messy.  So we settled on the day we were supposed to have our trial which a few weeks prior her new husband was moved from Germany to Fort Polk.  They ended up moving to Louisiana at Fort Polk and I stayed in Georgia. I tried to see my daughter as much as I could (once a month). She lived with me for a few months when her little brother was diagnosed with cancer and was in and out of the hospital. They then moved to Colubmia, Sc and I saw her more because a 12 hour trip became a 3 hour trip.  Over the summer they moved to Daytona Beach and it's 8 hours again but i've been going 2 times a month to see her.  A few weeks ago her little brother was getting his scans and they found cancer again.  Her mother immediately pulled her out of school and enrolled her in virtual school.  Last week her mother texted me asking if I could take my daughter for the next month or so because they were going to be in and out of the hospital so much.  I of course said yes and checked with my daughter who was more than happy and excited to be coming up.  We really have a wonderful relationship.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday:  I work a normal M-F 9-6p job.  My fiance has a more flexible schedule and my mom and dad are right down the road from us and can help too.  Well today is one of the days were my fiance and I are both at work.  My mom is at home with my daughter today and helping with virtual school.   My phone rings and it's my mom. Sobbing.  She told me that my daughter had broken down during one of her online assignments after my mom tried to help her.   After trying to calm her down my daughter tells her story after story of her other grandmother hurting her.  Yanking her arm, hitting her with shoes, slapping her, verbal abuse.  I 110% believe my daughter.  Her grandmother is a very hot tempered cuban woman.  I don't know how to proceed from her.  My daughter is concerned about her brother and being taken away from him and she knows he's very sick. My daughters mother is also very hard to talk to and I still haven't forgiven her for what she has put me through 8 years ago.  I don't have the money now for more lawyers as I'm still in debt over the first one (over $75k worth of legal expense for nothing to change).  I need help or advice. Or something.  I'm at a loss.

Me [25F], boyfriend [30M], boyfriend's sister (Ashley) [28F].\n\nI have been dating my boyfriend for almost 3 years now. We met one another via some mutual friends and have been fairly inseparable since then. We come from fairly different religious and cultural backgrounds, which means that although our friends and family know of one another, neither of us have introduced our partners to our respective parents and probably will not do so until we either move in with one another or become engaged/married in the future. We are both content with this aspect of our relationship.\n\nMy boyfriend lives only with his sister, Ashley. I am currently living with my parents. I have yet to meet Ashley because she is apparently a little awkward and into herself and her own life (my boyfriend's words). Ashley is aware that we are in a relationship with one another, but has refused to meet with me. Ashley and I have both been in my boyfriend's house at the same time, but either I am in my boyfriend's room when Ashley wants to use the living room or the kitchen, or Ashley will be in her bedroom when my boyfriend and I are in the living room or the kitchen.\n\nI put this down to anxiety on Ashley's part because I have been ready and willing to meet her, however she has not been as forthcoming. I have not minded this arrangement and thought that we would eventually meet, therefore it has not really been a big deal.\n\nHowever, recently my boyfriend told me that Ashley had stalked my Facebook and Instagram accounts (neither of which are private) and she told my boyfriend that I am not \"attractive enough\" to go out with him and that he should stop seeing me. Admittedly Ashley is more attractive than I am, although her social skills leave a lot to be desired by the sounds of it.\n\nMy boyfriend has made it clear to both Ashley and myself that he does not care for her opinion and will continue to be in a relationship with me.\n\nMy question essentially relates to how I can navigate this. The situation does not make me feel any different for my boyfriend, although it makes me despise Ashley. I am not usually a hateful nor a negative person, but Ashley's comments have really upset me and it makes me question whether I would ever really want to know her at all. With this comes the problem of how I can potentially be in a long term relationship with my boyfriend and associate with his family (in this case Ashley) in the future.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for almost 3 years. Boyfriend's sister (Ashley) thinks I am not attractive enough to date my boyfriend. Ashley has never met me and based her opinion of my looks from my Facebook and Instagram pictures, which are fairly accurate.

I didn\u2019t mind, they weren\u2019t secretive, it seemed completely innocent. Then a few months ago it turned out he\u2019d been planning secret meetings and drives with her outside work. That I\u2019m not okay with. I was really angry he was hiding it from me, because there was no need to lie about things he was up to or keep things from me. It felt like cheating. He then admitted she might like him more than friends and he apologised profusely said he\u2019d been an idiot and said he\u2019d stop the friendship. (I didn\u2019t ask him to- but that\u2019s just what he suggested) anyway, I know he\u2019s still friends with her. She messages him sometimes, they spend all day at work together, I assume the secret meetings have stopped but I can\u2019t know for sure. \n\nI\u2019m finding it hard to trust him again. I don\u2019t know if all the flirty meetings have stopped or if they\u2019ve just got more secret.

Some background: we've been together 5 years. Live together. All is well. \n \nLast night: my boyfriend surprised me with a really nice thoughtful dinner, but then told me it's because I was about to be upset at him. We have been planning a long weekend getaway for a little while now, and I've been really looking forward to it. I've been planning hikes, looking at places to stay, and was about to invest in some solid new hiking boots. I was so excited, especially because he's been bugging me to get the time off work for a while. So I requested the time off and got it. \n\nUnfortunately, it's the world Cup final for rugby. My boyfriend's English and told me he's thought about this, but he can't miss the game. I kind of froze and just listened to him talk. He said it wouldn't be the same if it was just him and I watching it in some Airbnb or quiet pub. I didn't say anything for a bit and just ate. \n\nIm not going to lie, I felt extremely hurt. I have gone out of my way the last few weeks to wake up early or stay out ridiculously late to watch these games with my boyfriend. I don't love it, but he told me it made him happy when I was there, so I was more than happy to enjoy it with him and made the effort to learn the rules.\nI even coordinated with my dad to get a special program on my laptop so we could watch the final game together if we couldn't find a pub while we were away. \n\nI got very upset. Neither of us yelled, but my voice was raised a little bit. He didnt even ask me if we could maybe reschedule our getaway for another weekend, and that's what hurt the most. He just decided, without my input, that it wasnt going to happen. I told him how disregarded I felt, how disappointed I was, and he just kept saying sorry and he would make it up to me. \n\nI just feel like things are always his way or the highway, and I just felt done. It's the morning now and I didnt speak to him last night. I still feel really upset and Im wondering if I need to just get over this?

I countered him and told him that he has wasted my time, it\u2019s just crazy to me how we used to have the same standpoint on the right time to have children, which is when we finished our studies found jobs with good incomes and were stable. And now he has done a complete 180 which is terrifying. I have told him in depth this is not right and now he is calling me a bully telling me that I\u2019m just a bully for taking this too far, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. \n\nOne last thing it\u2019s not easy to get away from him and he is very possessive and says that I\u2019m his and he owns me, he says if I leave him he will embarrass me to my family and inform them of our past escapades and that he has prove which he will send to them. He knows they will disown me if he did and he will essentially ruin my life.

Besides recently having our second boy, we also moved to another city 6 months ago. Before we moved my wife and I agreed that her mom will come stay with us and help her out for a while (being pregnant, looking after a two year old etc). My wife had to quit her job when we moved so she's currently a stay at home mom.\n\nAfter 4 months living with us the baby arrives. There were some complications after my wife's c-section and she was in hospital for over a week. So the mom phones up her husband (my father in law obviously) to come and stay with us as well for 3 weeks or so to help out while my wife heals etc. (They're both retired btw.)\n\nEven though they mean to be helpful, it feels like they've completely taken over our household. We have a 3 bedroom house, so the mother in law is sleeping in my two year olds bedroom looking after the newborn throughout the night doing all the bottle feeds. My father in law is in the spare bedroom sleeping with my two year old. And then of course my wife and I in the main bedroom. It's a circus. \n\nThe smallest things annoy me, like before we weren't big on watching TV. The TV is now on constantly. On the news channel. I used to come home and cook (I love cooking), the mother in law does that now and she's a horrible cook. Her in laws are very untidy. I pay the bills for the house and they constantly leave lights on. I like to feed my kids healthy food but they give my two year old Coke and cookies and absolute garbage food whenever he asks for it.\n\nI don't feel that my house is my house anymore. I was brought up to be a very independent person and my wife the complete opposite, everything was done for her by her mom who was a stay at home mom herself for most of her life. She'd do her school projects, make her bed, you name it. Mommy is always there. \n\nMy father in law is going home tomorrow so that's one out the house. But my mother in law is still staying until my wife feels and is doing better. Yet when I ask my wife how she feels or what's still wrong with her she's very vague about the symptoms she's experiencing. From my point of view it looks like she's just trying to extend her mother staying with us. \n\nBut it's been 6 months! The first few weeks were fine, then I started getting annoyed and feeling bad about it (because she's just there to help remember), then it turned into anger, and now, 6 months later I just feel dead inside. I've lost the battle. I dread going home because it feels that I can't breathe there, her mom is constantly around! It's done so much damage to our marriage. I hate weekends and can't wait for Monday to come around so that I can get out the house. I try and spend as much time outside in the yard just trying to avoid my mother in law. Yet at the same time I miss just having my family, seeing my boys, being alone with my wife and kids. \n\nI try and hide my annoyance (though I've since given up on that), my wife of course notices and then gets upset at me over it. How can I get upset that her mom is there helping her out while she's recovering and helping with the toddler and newborn? It feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't have a home anymore. I can't get upset because her mom left the lights on **again**, or that she's watching news **again**, I can't come home and enjoy cooking for my family, and I can't have the relationship I used to have with my wife anymore because the mom is always around.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2157528, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mother in law living with us and I'm losing my mind", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572435047, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dooht5/mother_in_law_living_with_us_and_im_losing_my_mind/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yagirltiredt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ocj3po9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572348584, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/doohf1/i_snooped_through_my_partners_phone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "doohf1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 134, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/doohf1/i_snooped_through_my_partners_phone/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572348585, "score": 191, "selftext": "My partner always locks his phone, always clearing notifications on his phone screen and never let\u2019s me use it.

I finally opened my eyes to what I had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that I would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so I decided last thursday to tell her I wanted to end this marriage.\n\nI think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. She didn't even try to persuade me or anything. Just went like a broken record \"nothing I say will change anything\" whenever I asked her to say anything. There was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. We have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.\n\nMy mother knows everything, but I for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. Maybe I'm afraid of a \"war\" between my soon to be ex wife and me so I agreed to give her time to tell them. When we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. Instead we told them that there was some \"unsolvable disagreements\", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. They have been part of my family for almost 17 years and I care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. I felt really bad about lying to them, but I'm afraid that if I go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. But my patience is not limitless. I will tell them eventually if my \"wife\" doesn't come clean soon.\n\nI don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. I'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to \"growing apart, wanting different things etc.\". I also don't want to be known as the \"poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy\".\n\nNow there are some big loose ends to tie. We need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. The custody will be shared where I will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. I also feel like their legal address should be with me, so I won't have to pay her child support. Would be unfair after what she did. I have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. I will fight for my kids though.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2157397, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update: Me (36M) found out that my wife (34F) was cheating on me with multiple men", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572426105, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/don688/update_me_36m_found_out_that_my_wife_34f_was/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shortyspicee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wdtcvj2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572322279, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dokrsb/he_desires_to_be_poly_i_dont_is_divorce_next/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dokrsb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 151, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dokrsb/he_desires_to_be_poly_i_dont_is_divorce_next/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572322282, "score": 138, "selftext": "When is enough, enough?

I asked him about it a few weeks ago shortly after I posted here. \n\nMost of the argument was him denying every which way he could. He was defensive and aggressive as soon as I asked about it. He said he had no idea what I was talking about. He had nothing like that. So I said I'd show him, and he RAN ahead of me to the computer and told me to not \"touch his shit.\" Then more saying he had nothing like that and I was misunderstanding a book he'd downloaded or something. This was a word doc, not a pdf or other type of e-book. He insisted it was just a book. So why's it in an editable form? What's the title and author? He had no answer. He just got angrier and tried to draw me away from those questions. \n\nI said look we both know what I'm talking about. And I was asking because I was worried and wanted to support him, not because I'm mad or judging him (Like I said in the first post, I thought it could be tied somehow to his feelings about his parents' deaths). \n\nAll of that he hardly acknowledged at all. He only said it had nothing to do with his parents. Now he's always been pretty private about his feelings in general so I wasn't expecting some great outpouring of emotion. But he dismissed my concern like it was an absurd idea.\n\nThis was happening while he was literally standing in front of his computer desk to keep me from trying to show him what I'm talking about, remember he first said there wasn't anything about fat people on his computer... then he says it's something he downloaded but can't say what, and THEN he changed it to \"I'm allowed to write whatever I want\" and that he doesn't demand to know why I'm writing about romance (my sister and I collab sometimes on romantic-themed fantasy stories set in a world we made up as kids.) Since he compared it to my stories I asked if it was a story then? He then acted like that was obvious. \"Yeah it's for (friend's) writing contest\". His friend is a standard comic geek who primary writes Marvel universe fanfiction... like I seriously doubt this would fit any kind of writing contest he's hosting. If there even is a contest. Not to mention, my husband has never once shown an interest in creative writing.\n\nAnd remembering what I read it simply doesn't have the structure of a story. No title but file name was \"Trimming the fat for a better America.\" It's an incoherent angry monologue, it's repetitive with constant description of how gross obese people are and careens off into random torture scenes. No plot. No developed characters.\n\nI forgot to mention I'd started talking to him at night once he'd gotten home from work and eaten, so by this point I was really tired and just didn't want to keep arguing. I hadn't expected anything close to this amount of denial. I basically threw my hands up and said okay, and we went to bed. \n\nNext morning he acted like normal, like it hadn't happened. Ever since then it's been the same. I did try to ask a second time but he brushed me off saying he already told me it was for the contest. That was a very brief and calm exchange, not a fight. I haven't been back on his computer, I don't want to snoop on him.\n\nSo here I am now still with no more of a real answer than before. Kind of questioning why I'm even writing because nothing actually happened. But I saw I had a few messages of people wanting to know what he said so there it is. I'm basically accepting that it's his private thoughts. May or may not be how he deals with grief but I don't want him to stop trusting me because I keep pushing a comversation he doesn't want to have, so I'm not planning on bringing it up again. I'm still concerned he might be struggling with something, but I'm not sure what else I can do except making sure he knows I'm here to support and listen to him, which he does.\n\nThank you to everyone on my first post who gave thoughts and suggestions.\n\nTL;DR: Husband didn't want to tell me what was up with the document where he wrote about his hatred of the obese. We had an hours long argument about it where he gave a few contradicting explanations so I don't know what to believe. It's clear he wants to keep it to himself so I'm going to respect that.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2156829, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update: Found scary document on my (36F) husband's (38M) computer", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572403372, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dojsx7/update_found_scary_document_on_my_36f_husbands/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Bartko11", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4e61i1iq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572316244, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dojnt8/should_i_31m_tell_friend_30f_that_she_probably/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dojnt8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 142, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dojnt8/should_i_31m_tell_friend_30f_that_she_probably/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572316245, "score": 246, "selftext": "So I have had this friend for about 15 years. This is her second marriage. The first one with a kid and with this guy.

And stone walls the wife when she's upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last week they had a halloween october party for friends and kids and he was suppose to go pick stuff up. Like pizza and beer. Well he orders all this goofy pizza no one would like but him, like onions and pineapple.  She gets huffy and goes to get normal pizza like cheese, meat lovers and supremes, etc. So I'm sitting there with this guy, and he tells me how he wishes that everything didn't have to be about everyone else. That he wished it was about him again...\n\nI reassure him that she knows that he loves her and just gets like that because she knows he is on her team and doesn't have to be as polite. That he gets to have the real her and she gets the real him. Well he keeps on, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt finally dawns on me...this guy is jealous of his own kid and her friends. He doesn't want to be married. He doesn't want to be a dad. He wants to be single and date again. He wants a girlfriend.  Halfway abusing the kid, stone walling her when she is emotional, it all made sense. He resents the kid. He resents her being a mom. He wants out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, three or so weeks ago, they went to Disney World without the kid and everything is positive again and they are going to start for a second child.  She's thinking everything is great again because he's agreed to try for another kid. And he thinks stuff is great again because he's gonna get all this regular sex again, and she'll stop doing as much stuff with the kid and friends because they're trying for the baby. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I tell her what he said? That part of him isn't gone. That wasn't fixed by a 3 day long date. Yeah, he's going to be king for 9 months, but then he's going to get double ignored with a 3 year old and a new baby. Then what? More stone walling? More abuse of the kid? Will it stop there? Like if he's acting this way with being ignored for 1 2 year old, how will he act with 2 children? Start hitting people? Cheating with people that give him the attention he craves? Divorce? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what to do. Because really, if she is on cloud nine right now because he agreed to a second baby, she won't want to hear anything i have to say. And he might start to position things so I'm avoided. Cut her off.

We've had ups and downs and got through A LOT of shit together. I've never imagined life without her. \n\nBut my life has just come crashing down and i cannot stop my mind from falling into this mental abyss of nothing. 5 days ago i got sent a video of Ula having sex with my brother. I could tell it was from years ago, probably from when we were around 20/21. I nearly threw up. I didn't want to believe it so i just shut my phone down and just went about my day as normal. Obviously this got Ula a bit worried as i wasn't answering any calls or texting so she turned up at my door the next day. I know people will be wondering why we don't live to together and it's because i am finishing off my PhD and she has a good job in a bigger city so it just makes sense to not be living together right now. I digress. I tried acting normal but obviously Ula was shouting at me asking why i would be ghosting everyone, especially her. I just started crying. It just came to my realisation and the love of my life had slept with my brother. I was crushed beyond how i thought a human could be hurt. I collapsed onto the floor and just was sobbing. Ula held me for a while but then i just instinctively pushed her pretty hard away from me. I still didn't say anything at this point, and i got up,grabbed my phone and showed her the video. \n\nShe was stunned. She fell down onto the floor with her head in her hands. No words were spoken for about 10 minutes or so. I knew then that this was indeed no prank, it was true. My slither of hope had be taken away from me. She said 'i'm sorry'. Over and over. Don't know how long to be honest. She said it was one time and it was a mistake and when were on thin ice. Then my mind switched from being shocked mode to why does this video exist mode? The first thing i said after all the apologies was 'why did you have a sex tape with him?' and she just replied 'i don't know'. I think i kept asking her questions about why the tape existed. I'm not sure tbh. I was downing shot after shot of vodka because its what they do in the movies (how trivial right lol). Eventually she screamed stop and told me i should know it wasn't just this one time with my brother but she slept with my best friend when we were about 18. My best friend from childhood. I literally trust about 5 people in my life and now 3 of them have just completely carpet bombed my heart and head with this dishonesty and lying.\n\nI told her to get out and leave me alone. She tried to stay but the sight of her just made my stomach  wretch. Turned my phone off again and just drank until i passed out. Woke up and did the same shit until v.early today when i turned my phone on.\n\nI called my mum first. Told her what happened in full and just broke down on the phone. She immediately bought me a plane ticket (lives on the opposite side of the country) and told me to come home. So i did. I looked/felt/smelt like pure shit. But i knew being here would sort something out (probably the drinking lol). \n\nNow i'm just in bed writing this. I don't know why i want to share this story with strangers but i feel like you're the only people who will sit and tell me what's up with this fucked situation. I'm probably gonna have a big talk with mum tomorrow. My brother doesn't live near fortunately. Brother, Ula and best friend (F btw dk if matters) had been blowing up my phone. Ive blocked them all, i literally don't have any mental capacity to deal with it. I will have to deal with it but idk how. Pretty sure the family will want me to make amends with brother but idk. I also really don't know how much she cheated. Or how long she really cheated with brother/bff. Idk my head is so over the place and i'm finding it hard to just function normally. It's fucking weird. I've never had problems mentally but i've just shutdown. Ehhh fuck me i guess.\n\nFor some stupid reason my mind is focused on who sent the video and why (came from a anon fb account who private messaged me). I guess it diverts away from the cheating? The decade of lies? Idk reddit. I'm lost. I'm obviously not on main account due to them knowing it. Who knows. Maybe they'll read this, in which fuck you and fuck you again.\n\nThanks if you read all that. I don't even know what i'm asking in reality. Maybe some guidance into what to do next.

I think the stigma of males and harassment really made me doubt myself, I felt like a little bitch and thought I was over reacting but if a girl were in my situation I do see how concerning that would be.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2156284, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FINAL UPDATE: I (19m) am being stalked by a guy (26m) in my uni accommodation and I don't know what to do.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572386646, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dog8wc/final_update_i_19m_am_being_stalked_by_a_guy_26m/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SmoothyBlonde", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3eqedwae", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572294776, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/doeuuu/i_24f_suspect_my_boyfriend_23m_of_being_into/", "gildings": {}, "id": "doeuuu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 157, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/doeuuu/i_24f_suspect_my_boyfriend_23m_of_being_into/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572294777, "score": 398, "selftext": "I (24F) am with my boyfriend (23M) since a year now.

We\u2019re all 28, known each other since college. When Sam (f) and I (f) were roommates after graduating, her and Tom (m) had been dating for a year Or so, and he went away for work for a summer. Around that time Sam confessed to me, very distressed, that she had cheated on Tom. At that point, I was only close with her, not Tom, so I opted to keep her secret. I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it once Tom was back, but I surprised myself and haven\u2019t said anything to this day. \n\nIf this was the only thing, I might just keep quiet, but although Tom and Sam are very happy now and have been for years, there are two other occasions in which I believe Sam cheated. She never said anything, and I have no proof, but I\u2019m 90% sure it happened. Once was when she met up with me and showed up drunk and with her coworker in tow. They were heavily flirting and I\u2019m pretty sure they went home together, though she says she just got an Uber alone when she left the bar. \n\nAnother time was around the same time, when her and Tom had been having issues, and she met up with an ex fling who she claimed was platonic. She didn\u2019t come home, but she said she got drunk and spent the night on his couch. Idk, seems suspect to me.\n\nLike I said, we\u2019re all close now, and I know nothing has happened since, but I\u2019m conflicted about two things... I feel like I need to have an honest discussion with Sam and ask her what happened, and suggest that she talk to Tom... which leads me to the second thing, if she doesnt tell him, should I?

This past year a few things have slightly not gone exactly as planned.\n\n  \nMy GF and I talked about moving in with each other about 2 years into our relationship. We decided that we would sign other leases and then in 2 years, we would move in together. We found places a few blocks away from each other in a neighboorhood in a large metro area. In these 2 year leases, we both have a roommate. Her roommate happens to find a guy and fall in love. She ends up not resigning the lease and moves in with her new bf. We look for a temporary solution for my GF. Things worked for a few months, but she ended up moving into her parent's house. Their house is about 45 min from me and her work but she stays at mine a lot.   \nShe is understandably is upset about this and wants me to break my lease and move in with her. In the past, she has been very aggressive with suggestions about proposing to her and used to always show me rings and diamonds that were quite expensive and demand that these are her expectations. \n\n  \nHer ex-roommate gets proposed to recently by the guy she moved in with. This doesn\u2019t make the tension better. We've been fighting a lot about various issues that always come back to these. \n\n  \nIn our recent fights, my only gripe is that almost every single weekend she plans dinners and drinks with her friends and family. She\u2019s from here and I\u2019m not. However, it\u2019s a large metropolitan area and I also have many friends here too. Practically, every weekend is planned for me and it\u2019s a huge fight every time I try to suggest not doing her plan. This has been going on for months with no breaks. We fight so much about how I just want a weekend to relax with no plans but we can never get that to happen. When I say that we've had nearly every weekend of the year planned, I'm not being sarcastic. I always pay when we go out and shes a picky eater so we always have to go to the best restaurants and usually at least $100-175 tabs for the two of us. This is just exhausting for me to do constantly. Not to mention that this is not part of my plan or financial goals at all.  \n\n  \nI finally have a free weekend coming up (this weekend) and she says she wants to surprise me with a weekend getaway. Ok, I\u2019m not from the city and I liked the outdoors. She knows this and we've been talking for months about going camping, getting a cabin, any way to get out of the city. We've gone camping twice but I know its not her thing so I don't push it. I've been very stressed about work recently on top of all of this. I've joked with her saying that if we go to see her family or one of her friend's house I will be pissed. I'm hoping for wilderness but I know it could be something else too. \n\n  \nSaturday comes and I go to pick her up at her parents (I still don't know where we are going). I start to drive and realize that we are going back the way I came to pick her up, adding 2 hours onto each way of our trip( 45-&gt;, Chat 15, &lt;-45). We're getting closer and she eventually tells me the destination. We're going to another close by, large city to meet up with 2 of our friends and go out to dinner and drinks. I am pretty irritated now because I have been a broken record these past 6 months saying that I desperately need to go easy and take a weekend off. Now my only weekend off in months, and for the foreseeable future, is spent driving 7 hours to go to dinner and drinks with friends in a different city for roughly \\~$200 on top of gas and tolls ... like we do every weekend in our better city (NYC). \n\n  \nI start the trip in a bad mood and reacted poorly but we talk and I try to comfort her because I know this trip had the best intentions and she put effort into it. I tell her that I'm going to make the best of it and we go out as planned and have a night. Were still upset with one another. She thinks that I'm so rude because I am ungrateful. I think she had good intentions but is so high maintenance and ultimately planned a trip for her that was not my idea of fun.   \n\n\nWe're basically on the verge of breaking up now and I'm exhausted with everything. \n\n  \nTL;DR Girlfriend and I have been fighting so she tries to plan a weekend getaway for me. It ends up being exactly what we do every weekend but a different city that I spend 7 hours driving for. She thinks I'm ungrateful but I think she didn't make these plans with me in mind.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2155718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Did I {28M} act out of line by being sour for a \"surprise\" that my gf {27F} planned for me?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572370247, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/doc301/did_i_28m_act_out_of_line_by_being_sour_for_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRA-mordorman22", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4w8zspip", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572283221, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dobxla/is_it_wrong_i_34m_fell_in_love_with_my_dead_best/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dobxla", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 231, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dobxla/is_it_wrong_i_34m_fell_in_love_with_my_dead_best/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572283222, "score": 1049, "selftext": "My best friend's name is Robert .

Her parents very graciously offered to contribute $50,000 for us to have a wonderful wedding celebration.  I come from a family that is well off, but not \u201cspend $50k on a wedding\u201d well off, so initially I\u2019m a little uneasy with such a large budget. I half seriously suggested a small wedding and using the money for a down payment on a house, but I expected that to get shot down and honestly I\u2019m looking forward to having a wedding so whatever.\n\nFast forward to present day. We are about $20,000 over our budget due to future MIL ballooning our guest list from 160 to 230. My fianc\u00e9e also was essentially unwilling to budge on her venue preference even though I told her if we went with that venue, we have to be strict on the guest list, go with a DJ over the band, and generally find other ways to cut costs. \n\nWe are both very responsible with our money and in great positions financially but I don\u2019t think we should be okay with this incredible display of extravagance. In my mind, my fianc\u00e9e and her mother have been too focused on the outward appearance of the celebration and have refused to acknowledge the actual costs. We received our initial final estimate this weekend and they both were shocked at the number.\n\nI\u2019ve now been asked to contribute financially to a wedding and I would rather not.

I guess I was so nervous that I had trouble getting hard for a while (which was confusing and awkward for both of us) but eventually we made it work and it was fine.

He's very kind and respectful and we really get each other. \n\nHowever, our whole relationship I've known he HATES tattoos. I think it has to do with his abusive mother and her plethora of trashy tattoos. We don't really talk about it much, but I'm aware of his feelings. \n\nI have a medium sized tattoo of some flowers on my upper back. There's not really meaning behind it; I just like flowers, and when I was 17/18 I thought tattoos were the coolest thing ever and I wanted one. Now, I don't care that much about it. Most of the time I forget I have a tattoo because I can barely see it in the location it's in. \n\nLast night, he was very quiet and I was asking him what's wrong. He told me he didn't want to make me upset, but I told him I wanted him to tell me anyway. He told me for a long time, he's been wanting to ask me to get my tattoo removed. I wasn't upset, I was very surprised. He said it's very important to him, that I'm perfect for him but this one thing just bothers him. When I asked him further, he had a hard time explaining why he dislikes tattoos so much, but did explain that 1. My body being different from its natural form bothers him 2. The idea of my skin containing ink freaks him out everytime he sees it. I'll update if he explains more. \n\nHe said that he would pay for it. I expressed my concern that this wouldn't be the only thing he ever asked me to do, and he said he understood why I would think that but that's not the case. I explained that this seems like a red flag in the relationship and he said that he understands why I would think that, but he would never do anything to hurt me. So far in our relationship, that has been very true. He never so much as raises his voice at me. \n\nI don't care that much about having the tattoo, I just don't want the pain associated with removing it, and I don't want to seem like a submissive woman who just bends to the will of her boyfriend. To address the first part, he said he's been researching it quite a bit and would want me to go to an MD who could use lidocaine to numb the pain. I was still worried, and he said he would even get a tattoo himself in the same spot and get it removed with me so that he would fully understand what I was going through. I don't want this, obviously but I don't have any doubt he'd actually do it. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I am scared of the process to get it removed, and I don't know if it's a healthy thing to do in a relationship. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated \n\nTl;dr \n\nMy boyfriend wants me to get my tattoo that I usually forget exists removed because tattoos freak him out.

So I was running a little late so I threw all my shit in my backpack and rushed to my lectures that I had all day. I forget about him and catch up with my classes.\n\nI forgot my memory stick because as I said I was running late and forgot to pick it up, so I go back to my room and as I'm in there I hear someone knock on my door, I open it and it's him, I'm a bit taken back, so I ask him what he wants, he says he came to apologise and says he fucked up and if we can be friends again, at this point... I don't want to be friends again, not because he threw himself at me, but because of the way he reacted after, he called me some mean shit that really fucked with my head all week, that I actually thought I did something wrong (being the reason I posted on AITA). I tell him this and he's a bit pissed but accepts my wishes. So, after that I think everything is good, and I go to the library with another male friend so he can help me catch up. \n\nI stay in the library until about 8pm and go back to my accommodation, I use my fob and start to trek up three flights of stairs to get to my room, I have a shit ton of folders in my hands but nothing I can't handle. I get to my corridor and I see him just lingering around the kitchen (some students sit and talk in the kitchen sometimes so it's nothing un-ordinary) he asks if I want help, I say 'no, I'm good thanks,' and begin to make my way down the corridors, he follows me and I hope to fuck he's just going to his room, but no, he starts talking and he says 'who where you with in the library?' so I'm like wtfff? did he follow me after I got my memory stick? I don't say that though, I just try and act nonchalant and say 'Richie (fake name) you know Richie.' He then says 'yeah, you're always with him and inviting him round, are you his toyboy or something?' then he laughs... and I'm feeling uncomfortable as hell now, and I just say 'no, nothing like that ha' and enter my room and basically shut the door on him.\n\nOn Saturday I went see Richie, I didn't want him coming here for obvious reasons, so I'm headed out and he comes out of his room and asks where I'm going, I tell him 'a friends' this time and don't mention Richie. He then gets mad (like i'm not allowed to have friends, these friends I have known way before him) and says 'maybe you should stay and study instead, you don't wanna fall behind after missing all your classes' and I KNOW he's been stalking my every move while I isolated myself last week. I get pissed off and say 'what? are you stalking me now' and continue to tell him to leave me alone. \n\nSo today is monday, I literally finished class an hour ago and there he is again, lingering around and waiting for me to come up the stairs and into the corridors, I ignore him and he makes a passing comment 'that jumper is way too big for you but it looks good' I ignore him this time because I can't be arsed with these comments. \n\nI'm cooped up in my room, on my laptop typing this and he's making my life in uni hell. I can't leave my room, I can't invite friends over, I can't go to the library... And before you tell me to go to our uni about this, I can't. 1. this is happening outside of uni, our accommodation doesn't have much to do with them 2. they're fucking useless anyways. I don't want to move and I'm scared if I say anything they will fuck with everything else in my uni, I like my classes, I like my friends. \n\nShall I continue to ignore him until he gets bored, shall I get another friend to accompany me so he can't say invasive shit?

Our previous roommate moved in with her boyfriend, so we found a new roommate (25F) via an app. She seemed nice, a little introverted and down to earth. She was supposed to move in next week.  \nHowever, she's already sleeping in the empty room, even though she still has her old (furnished) apartment. But she doesn't really sleep, she stays awake all night long. Last night she asked if she could sleep in my room, since she doesn't want to be alone right now. I understand that new situations can be frightening, so I agreed, even though I had to get up early. But she kept waking me up at night because she can't sleep. Apparently, she's scared of something but doesn't want to talk about it. I turned on a night light, made tea and talked to her for a bit.  \nMy other roommate and I both feel for her. But we have no idea what's going on and we also don't understand why she's seeking comfort from total strangers, when she has a few of her best friends living in the city (according to her). We also don't know if something happened in the past few days or if this is reoccuring behavior. I don't mind if she needs to sleep in my room from time to time, but I'm not willing to compromise my sleep every night.   \nShe's also showing other behaviors that seem strange, like asking for something (clothes, tea) and not using it. Asking to be picked up from the intercity bus stop because she doesn't want to be alone (she knows the way, she's lived here for years) but walking around on her own outside for hours at night. Also behaviors that would be considered rude (leaving my door wide open even though I'm sleeping, not cleaning up after herself), but she doesn't seem like a person who would normally do that.  \nIf she was a good friend of mine, the situation would be totally different. But this is a person I've met four times in my life and don't really know anything about. \n\nI'm worried that something has happened to her recently and that's why she's showing this behavior. But I'm also worried that she's (currently) emotionally unstable and not really able to live on her own. I feel bad asking for reasons since she obviously doesn't want to talk about it, but I feel unable to assess the situation and the necessary support for her.\n\nI mostly want to ask you guys, if anyone recognizes this kind of behavior and what you think of the situation. I would also like to get some advice on how to handle the situation, how to support her emotional needs appropriately while still establishing necessary boundaries. Thanks in advance!

He\u2019s freaking out, crying that I\u2019m going to break up with him, I was taken aback but supported him, he got tested, and was positive. \n\nAbout that same time I had a breakout, and it was fucking terrible.

She even went and go ahead and said she\u2019d marry me and looks at me as being \u2018the one\u2019 for her. \nHowever, before me she just got out of a 5  year relationship with a previous guy who is still in her life. This person is in fact still in love with her and expresses that to her mostly any chance he gets via texts and whatnot. \n\nSkip to now. Last whole week we didn\u2019t meet until Friday night where I hoped we could meet since I was going away to my hometown for the weekend to see some friends again. So it would have to be monday eve before we could see eachother(7 days without one another). Something I dreaded bc I really wanted to see her. The whole week I had to study for my exam and really needed some relaxation time with her. But she planned a girls night which I knew a day in advance. I was texting her the whole night basically saying I just wanna see her real quick and I would be out of her hair. Just a kiss or anything. I live in the city center next to all the bars so it wouldn\u2019t be a big hassle. Anyway she expressed she wanted some quality time with her bestie and others and was pretty aloof in the texts. She also had been drinking. \n\nI was blinded by love and the extreme desire to see her. So later that night I go and look her up in the bar (she didn\u2019t say where she was I just know which bar they go to always). Deciding to quickly surprise visit her. Oh boy did I F up. Turns out she was first of all kinda shocked I showed up. We went outside and talked and she seemed really not amused that I came. After that I went home. Soon after she felt bad for sending my away she showed up at my place explaining to me how it felt very suffocating what I did to her just then. I, feeling very dumb for doing it, said I was sorry and I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen at all. I just figured I was being spontaneous somewhat. I just really wanted to see her bc of the love we share. She said don\u2019t worry about it. I didn\u2019t ruin things. Just that she needed some space to contemplate everything. After I met her mom Monday night at her place before she also felt very rushed and suffocated apparently. Saying she needed tonight to really reset things a little. Which would explain why she was so absent that whole week with the texts. \n\nI wasn\u2019t really aware of that all. I completely miscalculated the whole situation. During this our energy we had before was also way off. Like we  looked at eachother very differently all of sudden. She slept that night at my place since her friend at that point took a guy home where she would originally stay the night with. We had no sex just kissed eachother for a little while. The next morning she left saying explicitly two times to me \u2018don\u2019t worry about it alright?\u2019. She could tell I felt really bad for what I did. We spoke via text last night really quickly. Saying again that I shouldn\u2019t worry and that she \u201cneeded/needs some space\u201d. And today we didn\u2019t spoke at all. Which is a first.

Moreover, out of the 10 people invited, I only know Nick on a personal level. \n\nI told Nick I might come but nothing's confirmed, but Nick made it very clear that he wants me to show up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis afternoon, Nick asked if I'm single and he told me a friend of his (let's call her Kathy, 25fm; note I didn't know it's a she before I got to the party) is bringing a female friend (let's call her Gina, 25fm). \n\nI told Nick yes I'm single, but not actively looking to see someone. The conversation ends. No big deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will briefly mention how the seating is arranged because I think that's kind of important: the table is a long rectangle and there are 4 people each on the long side and 1 person at each end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI show up to the party last, maybe half an hour later than everyone else. \n\nI see Nick, he's seated at the end of the 4 person row, and the immediate two seats next to him are occupied with Kathy and Gina's belongings. They were at the washroom.\n\nBefore I even sat down (or met Kathy and Gina face to face), Nick pulled me out for a smoke and told me that he had met Kathy on a dating app three weeks ago. They've gone on a few dates but nothing's exclusive and he was hoping that they'd score tonight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe explicitly told me that he wanted me to be a wingman and occupy Gina's attention. Cool.\n\nWe go in. I got a beer from the bar and go sit down. The girls are back now; I introduce myself.\n\nThe weird thing is that Gina is the one sitting next to Nick and I'm sitting next to Kathy. \n\n(So it goes: Nick - Gina - Kathy - Me, on one side of the table)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo big deal. I remind myself I'm here to be the wingman, so I started a conversation with the random people sitting right across from me and made an effort to not engage too much with Kathy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout half an hour after I sat down, I started talking to Gina and Kathy. Turns out we have a lot in common. \n\nWe go to the same school for graduate studies. Share the same interests. \n\nShe's a violinist and we laughed at some classical music memes. \n\nI told Kathy how I got too drunk last month and bought a single first row ticket to a chaykovsky violin concerto next month. In reply, she told me I should just come watch Gina and her's recital. \n\nShe asked me where I worked and I said XXX(a fancy startup hub/office building); she got real excited and asked if I saw her on Monday because she was performing in the lobby at XXX during that lunch break. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlah blah blah, you get the idea. We had a good convo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs everyone's plate gets emptied, I look over to Nick. \n\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUK THE BIRTHDAY BOY LOOKS PISSSSSED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my mind I'm like, damn I fucked up. \n\nAs we left the restaurant area and moved towards the arcades, Nick asked me rhetorically \"if I'm here to help him or cockblock him?\n\nI apologized for not being cool and told him I was just trying to be friendly (which I genuinely was). \n\nSoon Kathy and Gina left and Nick seemed even more upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNick told me it's not my fault but acknowledged that I wasn't cool. He said he's just upset that they left so early and he wasn't upset at me (he clearly was, though). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left shortly after and I felt pretty damn bad about the whole situation. But on my way home I started to have this 'falling in love' 'strong crush' feeling.\n\nNick and I live close to each other so I immediately messaged him and was like \"can we talk after you get home?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now here I am. I just got back from Nick's place.\n\nI asked him if he genuinely liked Kathy or if he just wanted to get laid. \n\nBecause... I couldn't help myself from being attracted to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe played the macho man attitude and didn't engage with my dialogue seriously whatsoever. \n\nI understand. But I've known Nick for years and I thought we could have a healthy conversation about where our minds stand. \n\nTurns out that's not the case because he shrugged me off and pretty much told me to leave and he'll see me some other time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess a few questions:\n\n\\- I don't have their contacts. But it was effortless to find their insta. Would it be wrong if I clicked follow?\n\n\\- Nick just got out of a relationship right before he met Kathy and from my perspective, Kathy and Nick have little to nothing in common. In addition, the only concerns I've heard from Nick over the night was that \"he was really hoping to get laid tonight\". \n\nI would have a very bitter feeling if they fuck for a few times and he ditches her. \n\nIs it such black and white that if they met first, I should just back-off no matter what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Roasting and random comments are welcomed.

Despite my health issues, I fixed broken parts of their house, I  deep cleaned it from the basement to the attic and wall to wall (it was in really bad condition), I helped all their friends with chores they couldn't do, I even cleaned behind his wife everytime she would make a mess. I was playing them piano, I replaced their used furniture with my new ones, and above all, I was happy and thankful for that opportunity. \n\nAbout 3 weeks in, slowly they both started to treat me poorly. They would denigrate me in front of their guests, they would call me their \"little slave\", ignore me when I talk, but the worse was that his wife was never respecting my personnal boundaries and imposed me a lot of hardships in times where I couldn't manage it. For example, I had a cat. A very shy and freightened one that I rescued. She meant the world to me. They had about 5 big savage cats and she would always purposefuly open my door for her cats to go \"disturb\" (attack) mine, even though I told her many times that it was traumatic for my cat and asked really nicely to not do that. It was \"little things\" but done out of disregard or even malice, in all objectivity. What hurt me the most, was the fact that everytime I tried to bond with my dad and talk about shared interests, he would dismiss it, ignore it, or share as little as possible. \n\nIt went on and on with those things for about 3-4 months. To a point where I started to involuntarily isolate myself and felt seriously suicidal. \n\nI found myself at the hospital for about 2 weeks and never went back there. I was granted shelter at a friend and after 2 months, I had found a job and moved out into a new apartment. I called my dad once I got out from the hospital to tell him I was ok and I never talked to him again since.\n\nTonight he called me. Obviously drunk. Told me about the recent death of an uncle and told me he wanted to see me and hold me in his arms. He told me he loved me and missed me. \n\nIt feels like so much to process and I have a hard time to be at peace with all of it.

This is kind of a long story and I\u2019ll have to skip around a bit to tell it, so I\u2019ll try my best to include a tl;dr at the end for anyone who wants to get to the point.\n\nMy (24F) boyfriend (24M) and I have been together for almost five years. We had to move back to my parents house after living on our own in a different city for three years and it\u2019s been pretty tough with quite a bit of conflict in the house as a result. I haven\u2019t been dealing with things as well as I should be, so I\u2019ve been in therapy for the past few months. Generally, when anyone asks me how it went or what I talked about, I respond pretty vaguely with anything like \u201coh, it went well\u201d or \u201cit was a little tough today\u201d or \u201cwe talked about a little of everything.\u201d I like to keep what I talk about private for the most part, and my therapist agrees that no one is entitled to know what we discuss during our sessions, so I\u2019ve been doing what makes me most comfortable and keeping it to myself unless I genuinely want to talk about something. My boyfriend has been in therapy as well and he is of the mind that talking about what you\u2019ve been discussing is good for you and, apparently, expected. \n\nWe\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats much more than usual due to the tension in the house and lots of other factors - some which are very much within our control and others that very much are not. We had one fight about a month ago now and I felt that I was at fault. I apologized, but my boyfriend went on and on about how much I hurt his feelings and how I was so wrong to say what I said, etc. When you\u2019re already in a bad place mentally it\u2019s very easy to absorb someone telling you that you\u2019ve been awful and use it in the wrong way. For some reason, and this hasn\u2019t been the case previously, him saying these things lead to a lot of self-hatred and negative self-talk for me. I wanted to feel as horrible on the outside as I did on the inside and I asked him to be much rougher than normal with me the next time we had sex. I phrased it as \u201cI\u2019d like for you to be rougher with me during sex,\u201d just for future reference as you continue reading. This ended up being the same night, and he choked/slapped/generally mistreated me and while I didn\u2019t feel better at the end of it all, I felt like I had been punished for what I did and it felt right. Obviously this isn\u2019t the healthiest mindset, but whatever. It worked at the time. We\u2019re rough without being too rough with each other regularly anyway, so I didn\u2019t think anything of asking for this or experiencing it. We\u2019re also accustomed to waking each other up during the night with kisses or soft touching to have sex and then go back to sleep. \n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago. We fell asleep together one Saturday night and I woke up to the feeling of my underwear being pulled off and his erect, lubed penis being shoved into me. I had been dead asleep on my side so that\u2019s the position we were in while he was holding me down by the back of my neck and really going for it. I didn\u2019t know what to do, and I felt like I was frozen. I just laid there, breathing heavily and trying not to cry. I guess it took my brain a minute to catch up to what was happening, and by the time I was aware enough to have a complete thought about it, all I could do was ask him not to finish inside of me, but it was basically too late for that too. It was over, and I just pulled my underwear back up without even looking at him, turned away from him, and went back to sleep. The next morning we talked about it and he apologized for doing something that I didn\u2019t enjoy. \n\nThe following week was a lot of dealing with feelings of humiliation, shame, anxiety, and confusion. I waited another week before bringing up what happened in therapy, I guess because I thought if I just waited long enough it wouldn\u2019t bother me anymore and that it didn\u2019t have to be a big deal or anything, because it\u2019s not like he raped me. He just misunderstood my previous request for him to be rougher with me. My therapist let me explain what happened without interrupting and we talked about a few other things before he asked if he could be completely frank with me. I said of course yes, and he told me that what I experienced was rape, regardless of my boyfriend\u2019s intention. He also said that this is a kind of rape that is only recently being recognized as such. This crushed me. I was really trying to let myself believe that it wasn\u2019t some horrible thing, just weird sex that I\u2019m allowed to pretend didn\u2019t happen. \n\nNow we come back to the part about my boyfriend thinking that people should talk about what they discuss in therapy. He\u2019s been pressuring me since day one, but especially in the past month, to tell him what I\u2019ve been talking about with my therapist. I continuously tell him I\u2019d rather not, and most of the time he\u2019ll begrudgingly accept it. Sometimes he pushes me enough that I give him a few tidbits, enough to placate him. Today we had another fight that devolved into him telling me that not telling him what I say in therapy is akin to keeping secrets and that it\u2019s not right for me to keep it all to myself. He kept going and going and I kept denying and denying until finally I started yelling \u201cFine! You want to know what we\u2019ve been talking about? We\u2019ve been talking about how what you did to me WAS rape and how I\u2019m supposed to deal with that information!\u201d \n\nNow, reader, I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting from that statement. It kind of just flew out of my mouth in a moment of anger and frustration. What I did not expect, though maybe I should have, was for my boyfriend to turn around and make it about himself. He started going in on how now someone out there thinks he\u2019s a rapist when it\u2019s total bullshit to call that rape and he was just doing what I told him to by being rough with me. That just because I didn\u2019t like it or wasn\u2019t into it doesn\u2019t make it rape and how many times has he had sex with me when he wasn\u2019t super into it or vice versa and are all of those times also rape? And am I not also a rapist for that? He called my therapist an idiot and said I\u2019ve only been getting worse since I started seeing him. He said that calling this rape affects him more than it affects me. I ended up agreeing with him just to get him to stop. And now he\u2019s calmly playing video games and engaging in conversation with me. \n\nAm I being absolutely ridiculous here? I don\u2019t think my therapist is wrong, but I also don\u2019t think my boyfriend is a rapist. I think what happened was an unfortunate miscommunication that culminated in a really humiliating violation that, yeah, we can call rape. I just feel really confused all over again and like now my experience is being minimized and kind of erased because my boyfriend is offended at someone calling it what it was. \n\nTl;dr my boyfriend pressured me into telling him what I talk about in therapy. I talked about how I felt he violated me and my therapist called it rape. He\u2019s offended and thinks the term rape is inaccurate and affects him more than the actual event is affecting me. I feel hurt and embarrassed all over again. Not the best summary, but maybe you can skim. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I want advice so much as I do reassuring words. Maybe I just needed to let it out and see if anyone agrees with me. Sorry for this being so long. I feel hurt in an oddly non-specific way.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2153714, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (24F) boyfriend (24M) may have raped me?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572314105, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/do05jv/my_24f_boyfriend_24m_may_have_raped_me/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "will74019", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4w1l0by7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572212041, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnzge3/girlfriend_sleeping_in_bed_with_guy_friend/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dnzge3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 162, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnzge3/girlfriend_sleeping_in_bed_with_guy_friend/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572212042, "score": 187, "selftext": "My girlfriend is wanting to save 500 on a cruise by sharing a room with a guy friend i.e. sleeping in the same bed, I told her I dont like that she would be sharing a bed with another man her response was \"you dont trust me enough to not have sex with him? \" I said that's not even the point then she went on about how he is overweight and that it wouldn't happen.. prior to dating she had shared a bed with him on a trip before telling me how he kept saying he would eat her out.. anyways she asked me to get others opinions so here I am.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2153527, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Girlfriend sleeping in bed with guy friend", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572313279, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnzge3/girlfriend_sleeping_in_bed_with_guy_friend/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "doboppitybeepboopbop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2mowovqe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572209291, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnz21i/my_20f_510_boyfriend_25m_54_is_disrespected_by/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dnz21i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 47, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnz21i/my_20f_510_boyfriend_25m_54_is_disrespected_by/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572209292, "score": 1050, "selftext": "Like the title says.

The conditions get worse and better with time, and overall should improve with age. If you're familiar with [the spoon theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) she can have weeks or even months where she has very few spoons, showering only every few days, and often losing jobs due to attendance. Further complicating these issues is a 3rd, very dangerous health condition. While not as debilitating, it could easily kill her and doesn't help her situation. She has been unable to obtain a work from home job, which while she would have many days where she could barely do it, would make work a possibility. We're in the USA, and social programs while not terrible, aren't great for her either. She dropped down to part time in December of last year, and lost her job about 5 months ago, and has zero income. For the past couple years she's been constantly underemployed with bouts of unemployment, meaning she hasn't helped me at all with rent or other bills which she had said she would when moving in with me. Her family is of no use or assistance even though she's asked for help. The only benefit she's been able to obtain is food stamps, and the &lt;$200 she receives from that doesn't even mitigate the $250 i'm paying for her marketplace health insurance.\n\nThat leads to my problem. For at least 3 or 4 months, I've been supporting her 100%. Paying health insurance, giving her spending money to be able to travel to appointments, etc. Prior to that it was In addition, she can't do any chores and has trouble even doing her own laundry. The place is an absolute mess. I do what i can, but i'm working 50-60 hours a week to keep afloat. Even then my financial situation is poor, but slightly, slowly, improving with extreme effort. I can't just give her 100% of my free time. I've got an elderly father (70M) that I often have to spend my free weekends helping. Say at least 25% of the time. At this point, she's almost not my girlfriend, but a child i have to take care of. We have very little quality time. Only some time spent talking in bed, which is to me quite boring. I can't even get her out of the house for a movie or any fun activities. I can't keep doing this. If i break up with her and kick her out she will end up homeless unless she receives some sort of government benefit which we've been seeking constantly but she's received none. This would make me feel like shit. I'm stuck between the figurative rock and hard place and I don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend is disabled with low energy. Has gotten worse unexpectedly.

Mainly because his wife has never liked me and has always made a point to say things to put me down. They got married when I was 16 and I lived with them for 2 years before I moved the fuck out as soon as I got into college at 18. Those two years were pretty awful, my dad's wife (Janet) would say mean things about me in front of my friends and also in front of her kids. For an example, I remember she once made comments about bleaching my \"mustache\" and how it was so noticeable (it wasn't) when I had this guy I was crushing on over. I remember being super embarrassed and horrified. I would complain to my dad but Janet would always make it out like she was only trying to help and I was reading into things and being \"a teenager\". \n\nAnyway, ever since I went to college I pretty much don't see them that often. I go over on holidays at times but I always feet out of place and it really isn't like I am very close to my dad anymore to see them. But I wish I was still close to my dad. We were really close before he married Janet.\n\nLast week my older sister (28F) had a dinner for family before her wedding. I attended with my boyfriend and so did my dad and Janet. Janet kept making jabs at me throughout the dinner. Just random shit about how I am never around and how I wouldn't know about x event  cause I am too good for them etc. Stuff like that. I laughed it off cause I didn't want to delve into it.  She then started making jokes about me going to graduate school and implying I will end up with a useless degree and no job. Again, I ignored this and just told her \"we'll see\". I could tell my boyfriend was getting upset so I tried to steer any conversation that even was remotely about me and it worked for a while. But.....then Janet (who I think was becoming increasingly drunk as the night went on) asked my boyfriend whether he didn't find me annoying and \"you will eventually\". Boyfriend told her that he finds me anything but annoying and I could tell from his tone he was really angry. So again I tried to change the subject. But then sometime later Janet says something along the lines of how my boyfriend seems like he has the \"total package\" and how she doesn't \"get\" me and him being together and \"of course \\*my name\\* is nice  and all but she is just our \\*my name\\*\"  At this point boyfriend told her to shut up and asked her wtf was the matter with her. Janet also got upset and told my boyfriend not to talk to her that way. Janet started crying and asked my dad to look at how I was allowing my boyfriend to talk to her. My dad comforted her but did not say anything to me.\n\nAt this point I left with my boyfriend. My sister was pissed at me for ruining her dinner (but later said it was mainly Janet's fault) and my dad called me yesterday and said that Janet was just trying to figure out what my boyfriend's \"intentions\" were cause he is older (he is 28 -\\_-) and was just looking out for me. Or some bs like that. I am so tired of my dad defending Janet. But Janet has also never had any trouble with my sister and so I do wonder whether it is me. Like maybe I am just very sensitive and unable to take a joke. It could be true. Sometimes that happens with my friends too but idk. It just feels different with Janet. Sometimes I wonder whether I am just unable to handle her personality. Boyfriend absolutely hates Janet now.  \n\nEither way I am very tired of this. It doesn't happen often cause I don't see them often but every time it really fucks me up for a while (again maybe I am sensitive) and I don't want that. Boyfriend asked me after the incident what I gained from having any sort of relationship with them and I honestly could not think of a single thing. I am thinking of just cutting ties with them (dad and Janet) altogether after my sister's wedding. It sounds like a simple thing to do but it makes me uneasy and idk it feels wrong on some level. Am I overreacting? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: My dad's wife made comments insinuating I am not good enough in front of my boyfriend.

I am a F21, live still at home, Europe. \n\nSo my dad had an affair for 2 years. I got a message from the daughter of his mistress, saying my dad has an affair with her mom. \nThe evening we confronted our dad with it and our mom got to know the second life he lived, hell broke loose. There was a big fight with yelling and even grabbing arms and throats. My dad was agressive, and this was and is for me the biggest red flag ever, not something I can forgive I think. \nTime passes and my parents want to work on their relationship and go to couples therapy from a clinical psychologist. Now this is my mom's choice, if she thinks she can be happy with my dad again, than I won't be the one sabotaging it. I'm having troubles moving on, and seeing a therapist for myself too. I try to act supportive though, I'm not a troublemaker at home. \n\nNow last week I wake up at 2am from yelling again. It's again a fight. (later I learn that the trigger now is that my dad says he doesn't get enough affection from my mom. It all goes to slow for him). When I get down to see if everything is under control, my dad went outside to cool down, I thought. But my mom tells us he said he was going to drive in the canal with our dog. I look outside and he already took the dog, walking toward our car. \nWe stopped him and talked him into coming inside, calming him down. I asked him if he could think straight and if I should call the emergency number, if he intents to harm himself or anyone else. He says I shouldn't call, he'll stay inside and won't harm anyone. \n\nNow everything is like nothing happened, again. My dad was aggressive in a previous fight, threatened to kill himself (and our dog). But still no actions were taken, nothing happened. He attacked me emotionally, I quote: \"I love all of you, you're all treasures to me, but you a little less\" pointing to me. This hit me hard, maybe he said it because I'm a little slower in the processing of the affair, aggression, fights? Because I can't fake like nothing ever happened? My parents slept in the same bed every night, even the night of the fights. They still kiss. They act like this was \"a small fight\" instead of a serious situation. \n\nWhat's right to do now? I'm looking for advice on what to do and how to live in the same house as my own dad that did all these things. I can't fake forgiveness and every interaction with my dad feels unnatural and awkward to me. \n\nTldr: my dad had an affair for 2 years, we found out about 2 months ago. My mom tried to move on, very fast to me after lying for so long and aggression in the fight. To me it feeled more like pretending nothing happened.

It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.\n\nI was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.\n\nI did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. \n\nOne of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. \n\nIt kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.\n\nI have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up.

But in the time since I originally posted my question, everything just went absolutely insane. The situation is resolved now, but the sheer level of insanity merits an update\u2026.\n\nWarning - there is some repeated strong language used. It's been censored but people who are offended by anti-woman slurs may want to avoid reading this.\n\n[Link to original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmukt8/my_26f_friend_32m_is_starting_to_scare_me/)\n\nI didn't mention this in my original post as it wasn't relevant, but Jack is also in a band, and within the genre he/his band is relatively famous. The band Rob is in is not famous, but they recently played a festival as one of the many opening acts.\n\nLast night I got a message from Rob. I'm not sure if I can include screenshots so I'm just going to paste the relevant bits here instead.\n\nRob: Your guy fucked up.\n\nMe: Excuse me?\n\nRob: He knows what he did. You tell him he needs to apologise. and if he does  I won't expose him.\n\nMe: I have no idea what you're talking about. Can you at least explain to me what's going on?\n\nRob: Your guy has been namedropping me. Do you know how embarassing it is for me to have my drummer ask me \"who is this c\\*nt\" because YOUR guy thinks he has a right to steal my drummer using my name. Maybe he doesn't know how the music industry works, so i'll cut him some slack and forgive him if he apologises to me.\n\nI didn't reply after this, because it was late and this seemed so ridiculous. I asked Jack what he had sent to the drummer, and he showed me a message that read, \"Hey, I'm gangthrow (Rob's friend)'s fianc\u00e9. I'm looking for a drummer for (he explains a side-project he's working on). If you're interested and have some free time, let me know!\n\nI then told Jack that Rob was offended by this message and wanted an apology. Jack was willing to apologise, because he thought maybe there was a miscommunication problem. I told him no, don't bother, you did nothing wrong and Rob is clearly being ridiculous. I figured I would ignore him and his empty threats, and the issue would go away on its own.\n\nWe went to bed. When I woke up this morning I had another message from Rob: \"I'm fucking livid about this gangthrow! Do you understand!? My name is my bond and I don't make introductions to people lightly. Who the fuck does he think he is!? Trying to tap-up MY drummer using MY name!? Fuckin' c\\*cksucker!\"\n\nI told him I thought he was overreacting, and he replied with: \" Well, let me be clear. Using your GF and who she knows to get an \"in\" with people is low rent as fuck! Your BF isn't on my level, i get it must be frustrating for him to see an ACTUAL musician hang out with his GF but, let's be honest; i play festivals, he can't even book a fuckin' garage. You can't see a problem with this!? Fine. I could go to your BF and sort it out but I gave YOU the heads up ... Obviously you don't actually care so here's your head's up; I'm done. Fuck you and your c\\*nt boyfriend.\"\n\nHe then went on to threaten to tell Jack that we had sex tapes together (we do not, at all), that what Jack did made him \"look like a c\\*nt\", that now that he was playing big festivals he didn't need to deal with me anymore and to \"look me up when you want to blow me\" (to which I said that he wouldn't need me for that since he's so famous now.) He then demanded I ask for forgiveness for making fun of his music. I replied with:\n\n\"yeah i'm not asking for your forgiveness for anything here. if anyone should be apologising, it's you. i try my best to be supportive and a good friend. and in return, for something completely outside my knowledge, i get insults and threats hurled at me? and you think i should be the one apologising? i am going to be perfectly clear. i'm not sorry Jack asked (drummer) to play in his band. i'm not sorry for cracking jokes. i'm not sorry about any of this. YOU are out of line. not me. you want to threaten to ruin a relationship and end a friendship because someone inadvertently made you \"look like a c\\*nt\"? go head. just showing that you don't need any help looking like a c\\*nt mate\"\n\nHe followed up with more threats to \"expose\" me to Jack as having been cheating on him the whole time, but I ignored them and blocked him. He hasn't tried to contact me by texting me, so with any luck this will be the end of it.\n\ntl;dr friend who started acting scary a few days ago turned into an absolute raging monster of insanity over a non-issue.

I (22m) am her only son. My parents are divorced, and I had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that I was living in Asia teaching English. I promised my mother that I would visit her when I returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before I came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. My mother told me I should visit my father first because of this.\n\nI should also add, that at this time and the past few years, I was very, VERY depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. I really wanted to be at my home where I felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. When I got home, my grandfather passed away on the day I arrived, and I was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so I stayed with my father for a few weeks. \n\nLater, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. I debated visiting her at that time, but I wasn't sure I would be feeling well enough to travel again. My grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but I told her I would have to think about if I can come then. Eventually I decided that I would visit them at the same time as my mother. \n\nThe night I arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. That night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. I was driving home from the airport at that time. I remember that night so vividly as I could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  My aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. I noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. They seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.\n\nAfter about a week I returned to my father's home and stayed there. I was an emotional mess for the following month. I had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. Eventually I began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that \"this is my fault\" and \"you killed your mother.\" I was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. They accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. They even insulted my father. Relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but I have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. I know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. Especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area. \n\nToday I received an email from my aunt that told me that I would have to go to court. It simply stated that I should call this lawyer. I am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. It's so difficult for me to think clearly, and I can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. Any advice would be appreciated.

He\u2019s used tobacco products and served in the military (which I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s relevant). He was given 6 months to live (keep in mind this was 4 years ago) and seems relatively healthy. He hasn\u2019t worked in 4 years either.\n\nHe claims to have no strength because of it, can\u2019t breathe, passes out on occasion (not frequently), and hasn\u2019t been in to a doctor or anybody (and refuses to) in these 4 years. I\u2019ve begun to have some suspicions, because he has made threats to B that he will kill him self if she leaves him. I\u2019m rather close to B, and from what I\u2019ve been hearing, it\u2019s a pretty rocky relationship with lots of fights. I hate myself for even thinking this, but I have begun to wonder if the breathing issues and strength are brought on by something else, like asthma, not being active/not doing ANYTHING (except drinking excessively on a daily basis, and B has admitted he\u2019s an alcoholic). He\u2019s shown lots of controlling/manipulative behaviors. Her friends are not accepted around him or his friends (which are always accepted around the house or to hang out). Even I am not accepted to be near him, his house, or his friends.\n\nHis friends joke about his cancer (I didn\u2019t add quotations because I didn\u2019t want to be assuming, because I already hate these thoughts). As does he. It seems to be a rather lighthearted subject that is not taken seriously, and it appears that nobody has a full truth from him. I have also noticed inconsistencies in his story. He claims to lack strength, but when S and I were on good terms, we would wrestle, and he easily beats me.

I'm also afraid of the consequences of talking to her about it. \n\n\nI never wrote long posts so I'll try to keep it snappy. I have been with my fiance now for three years and we are getting married in January. We have bee engaged for about one of those three years.\n\nLike every couple we have our ups and downs but they all seem to be about the same thing, our free time. I need to have some free time to myself which I usually spend playing video games or just relaxing. She has a need to spend quality time together which sounds easy enough. A lot of our previous fights we're about how I was running away from her to play games or what have you and I would argue that I need space and time to myself. To give you some reference of time, I usually play games about 2x/week for about three to four hours a time. I try to play at night when she is sleeping and has work the next day so I can stay up and not interrupt our time together.\n\n However, eventually the fights became about her not getting good sleep because I'm not there cuddling her. So I we agreed that I will tell her a day or so in advance that I will play games so she can mentally prepare and that I will come in by midnight so she can still get several hours of quality sleep. Ok no problem, managable compromise right? Then comes the question of her getting some quality time with me. \n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, I make an effort to take her out and do something out of the norm (surprise dinners, trips to places with old memories, special massage dates...etc.) which both of us enjoy! It's one of the great things about being in a relationship. The problem that I'm finding is that I have to do something like this once a week. Dinner and a movie doesn't cut it. And after three years I'm kind of exhausted. I've talked to her about trying to consider fancy dinner dates as quality time for us as well but that conversation usually ends in her crying and saying she's a terrible person for being so needy, which I then comfort her and tell her she's not needy, fights over and we move on. But nothing really changes. \n\nNow we're at a point where a lot of my energy and brain power is spent trying to figure out how to discover some new way to surprise her and keep her happy. She doesn't have any hobbies and her only friend lives 8 hours away so her free time is occupied by me. With most of my brain power and time being spent either figuring out a date or going on the date, I find I don't have any time for myself anymore. I see my friends once every two or three months, I play an hour of games every week or so, and I feel guilty when I do those things because I know she is suffering for it. \n\nThis was a problem early in our relationship but my thinking was that with more conversation would come understanding and ultimately compromise, but I think it's only gotten worse. I'm afraid to bring this problem up again because lately when we talk about this, she gets throw into this extreme sadness and talks about killing herself, or if I ever left her she's kill herself. This doesn't seem healthy to me but I'm afraid I'm too deep to back out now. Our wedding is this January and everything, including the honeymoon is already paid for. We also just bought a house together and have two auto loans together. Right now my plan is to just wait untill were married and then have a big sit down discussion with her about how I feel I've lost myself in all this. I don't know exactly how to handle this situation so I guess I'll turn to the internet for answers. \n\nI absolutely have to end this with the fact that I love this woman very much. She has a kind soul that is rare in this world and she means very much to me. I just want happiness for both of us. Please let me know if I made anything confusing or if this felt one-sided. \n\nAll help is welcomed.

I'm definitely my dad's daughter...and female lol some people thought I waa a guy. We look alike, we shared some genetic issues. He accused my mom during her pregnancy but once I was born there was no denying me I guess. Plus my mom just isn't that type. However my dad was a bisexual biker in a gang so he cheated a lot and was probably projecting.\n\n2. My mom didn't know about the secret visits. She found out years later.\n\nAnd finally I talked to my brother. We're both adults now and he's sober after years of deadly alcoholism. He says he doesn't remember any of it or even confessing that to my mom. (He has a horrible memory from the drinking) we went over a few things I remember and he has no recollection of it. so I asked the question on everyone's mind. Did my dad behave inappropriately toward him in anyway. He insisted my dad did not. He said he was aware our dad put too much on us as kids and made his problems our problems but he never acted sexually towards my brother. \n\nWe talked about what they would do together (go to hobby stores, burger places etc) and if my dad called me  from the bathroom and cancelled it could have happened but my brother doesn't remember anymore. So I guess this is just my issue to sort out. We of course ended our conversation on happy terms. I made sure he knew I didn't blame him for our dad's favoritism. I was a little hurt he played devils advocate and tried to give me our dad's reasons but I'm happy he's okay.\n\n99.9% of you were so helpful and supportive when I really needed it and I thank you so much for that. I really feel like I can focus on the good in my life and forget about my dad's bull shit . He doesn't deserve a second thought. I have a good life and to be honest he died poor, sick, and miserable.

I suspected something was wrong despite her saying otherwise so I called the relationship(???) off.\n\nAbout a week or two later she begun messaging me again apologising for treating me badly and we begun seeing each other again. She told me she began seeing this same guy AFTER I stopped seeing her and that was when she had sex with him. Flash forward a few weeks and I found out through a friend that she had sex with him at the festival while we were talking. I confronted her about it the other night, she admitted it and said she didn't want to lose me which is why she never told me. I just laughed at her, said I don't believe anything she says, she started crying for about an hour and we ended up eventually hugging it out. She told me she will wait for as long as it takes for me to give her another chance and forgive her. \n\nIt's not technically cheating but the fact that she lied to me about everything that was going on and the fact that I was her second choice is rather unsettling.

Sometimes he says weird things that makes me wonder if he\u2019s being creepy. Like, the other day he told me he had a dream about me. I asked him what it was about, and he just said it\u2019s best if he keeps it to himself. I thought it was weird, but I ignored it. He also talks about my appearance a lot, which I don\u2019t like. He always makes me out to be the most attractive person in any room, kind of hyping me up. I was talking to my mom about a boy I cut things off with that still texts me from time to time, and I joked with my mom, \u201cyeah he\u2019s still not over me.\u201d My stepdad interrupted and said, \u201cwho could get over you?\u201d Similarly, we ran into a boy at a restaurant that I used to have a crush on in school, and was talking to my mom about whether he remembers/recognizes me. My stepdad said, \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t remember you?\u201d and stuff like that. I think it could be seen as sweet, but for some reason I feel like it\u2019s creepy. \n\nHe also likes to touch my hair. He says that there\u2019s something like a fluff in my hair and he\u2019ll always reach to take the fluff out, but it\u2019s happened so many times that there just can\u2019t be that many fluffs in my hair. I never see the fluff, either. He also does it super slowly, and once his finger even grazed against my ear as he was doing it, it made me really uncomfortable. I also had hit my head and he came to rub it, and after that he made comments about how my hair was \u201csilky, soft, luxuriant,\u201d and a bunch of other comments. It just seemed like too much. Recently I was crying because I was upset about something and he was the only one there, so he comforted me. He later said that he\u2019s kind of awkward around people who cry, so that he didn\u2019t know what to do. He said he would have rubbed my head, but that he thought that would be too sexual. He also said that he would have put his hand on my thigh, but that I had shorts on, and that would have been too sexual too. \n\nThat\u2019s about it. I\u2019m uncomfortable with it.

His bio said divorced but I had seen him posting family photos on FB very recently, so I know he wasn\u2019t divorced. I took screen shots and told his wife, whom I do not know. He\u2019s now threatening me over FB messenger. Should I contact the police? I\u2019m concerned about her safety and my own. \n\nMy former coworker David and I worked together from September 2016 - January 2018. He was creepy and always made me feel uncomfortable. He had a wife but that didn\u2019t stop him from making vulgar comments towards customers and coworkers. \n\nHe would constantly be staring at his phone and one day I finally asked him about it. He proceeded to show me multiple live feed cameras in his home, including the bedrooms. He told me he had several Alexa home assistants, cameras, and two-way microphones. He then said, \u201cwatch this.\u201d And proceeded to tell Alexa to play a song in the living room. In the live feed his wife looked up from the couch and toward the speaker. It was weird and I asked if his wife knew about all of the cameras and he said yes. \n\nAfter a few of my coworkers found out from him showing off the features it became the office gossip about how weird it was that he watched his stay-at-home wife and daughter almost incessantly. He eventually got talked to by our store manager about using his phone and it slowed down. He also got a talking to when my boss overheard him make a derogatory comment to a customer. \n\nI left that job in January 2018. \n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago. I was doing my thing on tinder and who shows up? David. In his profile it said he was divorced and had multiple pictures of him with his daughter. I thought that was super weird because he had just posted family photos ~1 month before. I took a screen shot and sent it to one of my other former coworkers who was always into office gossip. She told me he was def still married. \n\nI didn\u2019t do anything else, but it really bothered me that this woman was sitting at home taking care of her kid while her husband was out in the world being a super creepy dude. So, finally, after a week I sent her a message through FB messenger basically saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t know me but I used to work with David and I found him on tinder here\u2019s a screen shot.\u201d \n\nShe proceeded to tell me they\u2019d been having problems and that she was out of the state and thanked me for telling her. I told her it always bothered me that he watched the cameras all the time and she said, \u201cwhat cameras.\u201d So, I told her about the cameras and the rough location she could find them based on my memory. She started freaking out and said she was very grateful that I told her. \n\nThis was last Saturday. I didn\u2019t hear anything else until last night. I get a message from the wife that said (quoting): CUNT! It was none of your goddamn business. \n\nI didn\u2019t respond and thought to myself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f well sis good luck to ya.\n\nAbout 2 hours later I get another message saying (quote): someone just hacked me. Pretty sure it was David. \n\nI told her I wasn\u2019t surprised that he\u2019s very tech savvy and she should protect herself. She said, \u201cI\u2019m fucking freaked out. I\u2019m scared of what else he will do.\u201d I told her to be safe and she told me she was somewhere safe and he didn\u2019t know where she was. \n\nThis morning I got a FB message from David saying:\n\n&gt; If you are going to talk shit about someone you should really make sure they don\u2019t get a copy of the conversation. Better hope I never see you in public. \n\nHis wife\u2019s FB has either been deleted or has blocked me because messenger is displaying the you cannot respond to this conversation message and her info is gone. \n\nI\u2019m really worried about my personal safety as this guy follows all my social media, knows where I live, and is clearly threatening me. I\u2019m also afraid for his waives safety. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I file a police report now or wait and see if anything happens?\n\nBefore anyone says it wasn\u2019t my business and I deserve this. I know it wasn\u2019t my business to rat him out to his wife. I won\u2019t ever do this again in the future. I spent almost a week debating over telling her or not. In the end I told myself, \u201cif it were me, I would want to know.\u201d Now it\u2019s completely blown up and I\u2019m worried about her safety and my own.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2150062, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (28F) found my married ex-coworker (35M) on Tinder.

She tends to get defensive and argumentative and lacks the ability to be vulnerable. \n\nThe following week after the breakup she was trying to apologize and get back together. I admit I didnt make it easy by ignoring her text while I was at work and not saying hi when I would get home. The other day she sent me a gift to my work place and when I got home we just sat in silence in different rooms. She started to text me and I explained to her as I have the rest of the week that we need that vulnerability in our relation to resolve our petty issues and move forward. Without that, I wasnt willing to get back together. Saying this caused her to escalate. I seen how much wine she had already drank, about 1.5 litres drank and a full glass on the table and an open bottle on the counter. I decided to take the wine away and dump it out. This caused her to escalate even more. I asked her to leave for the night, to crash at a friends or a family members house so we could do this better the next day with a sober mind to let cooler heads provale. She wouldn't leave. I called a mutual friend that is a female to help cool the situation as she started throwing empty wine glasses, but at me but st the floor with force. Our friend showed up and offered to take her to her place for the night and my girlfriend refused. My girlfriend insisted that we call the police to prove that she couldn't be removed from the home. When the police arrived and heard everyone out, they charged my girlfriend with mischief for throwing the wine glass, removed her from the home, and put a no contact order in place until her court date 3 weeks from now.\n\nI never wanted that to happen. I just wanted her to go sleep off the wine so we could talk with  sober mind. I never wanted her removed like this with no contact. The fighting was getting more frequent but this is the first time it got this heated. \n\nWill she ever forgive me? I feel like I have betrayed her with her getting charged. Is this over, or can this be fixed?\n\nI do love her with all my heart and I miss her so much already.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2150046, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My girlfriend was removed from our home by the police and now there is a 4 week no contact order.

Also I may be a little scattered, apologies.\n\nMy wife and I have been having a hard time for a little while. She had developed vaginismus and the lack of sex had turned into a lack of intimacy. I never forced her to do anything that would hurt her, we haven't had sex in... I don't even know how long. A year maybe. I've been supportive of her throughout this process, encouraging her to get help where she could and doing what I can to support her. I've been trying to keep passion and intimacy without sex, but it really hasn't been working. She doesn't let me touch her any more, she flinched last time that I (gently) grazed the back of her vagina with my hand. She had gotten irritated with me when I would slap her butt or something, which I've attributed to her sexuality making her uncomfortable because of it being painful for her.\n\nI'm in my third year of a doctoral program, and she just started her own doctoral program this fall. Needless to say, there has been a lot of stress for both of us these past few months. Sometime in mid-September we had a conversation about our relationship and just life in general. It was a hard and long conversation, but what it boiled down to was that she was having a \"quarter-life crisis\" and needed to figure out herself. She said she felt like she didn't know herself. We got together at a time in her life that she felt unstable, a parent's divorce, and she said she felt like I was a rock for her and she never really got to experience life on her own. I told her I understood and that I wanted to help her and support her in figuring out herself and life in general in any way I could. I've done extra things for her in the past weeks just to show her I'm still there and I still care, but I couldn't help but feel like she was distant.\n\nA few days ago we both had a few days to breathe and I suggested we go to a movie (joker was great!), but before the movie I saw she was texting someone with her phone close to her body to hide the screen. In a previous relationship, I had been lied to and cheated on multiple times and I recognized this sign in the back of my mind but shrugged it off. She had given me no reason not to trust her. If nothing else, we had great communication and could talk to each other, and I've been honest with her about my feelings and where I am at emotionally since or initial conversation. When we got home afterward I talked to her a bit more, told her that I felt shut out, that I didn't really know what was going on in her life. She got a little mad at me and told me that she couldn't be responsible for me when she couldn't even figure herself out.\n\nIn the few days since I've had horrible sleep. I kept thinking about her holding her phone to her chest to protect the identity of who she was texting. I had multiple dreams she cheated on me. It was just a dream though, I would tell myself, I have no reason not to trust her. A day or two previous to seeing the movie I saw she had a passcode on her phone now, and I asked her what it was. She told me, but did so while saying she never looks through my phone with a code. I reminded her that I told it to her when I did it, and told her the easy to remember number again. \n\nShe was asleep. Her phone was out. I tried the code. I saw an unsent text. I read it. I read the conversation. I wish I hadn't. She met someone when she started her program and has been texting. The conversations started a few weeks previous to our initial conversation. Innocent enough at first, stuff about class, but when he would send a few memes with X rated content she would laugh... at one point she sent a reading of her pulse immediately after one of these at 118. I looked at time stamps. Saw that she lied to me about where she was. Once when I asked if she wanted me to accompany her to the gym she said no and went by herself and then went to go hang out at this guy's house afterward. She has come home with the scent of his cat on her much to the excitement of our own cat, and told me that it was a cat belonging to another (female) friend of hers. I saw invitations to hang out to \"study/drink/hang out\" from him while I was at work or when she told me she was going to campus to study. There was another one this weekend, she told me she would be going to study on campus on Sunday... at the time they were going to hang out. I would think they were fucking from everything but... well, the vaginismus. So I strongly believe no sex has yet happened. I feel like they haven't kissed, but I'm not positive. I honestly feel they haven't yet though.\n\nI feel lost. I feel hurt. I feel like my trust has been betrayed. We just signed a new lease. I don't know what it going on and I don't know what to do. This hurts so much coming from someone that I've given everything to.\n\nI feel so hurt about this.

On her birthday, she walked by a house that is notorious for allowing their cats to breed unchecked, and she found a kitten (8mo F) that she wanted. So she asked the owners and they said to take her. I was like, yeah okay, that\u2019s fine since I\u2019ve grown up around cats and have missed having them. I\u2019d like to make this very clear that this is her cat. She is registered with the school to have an emotional support animal, I am not. \n\nSo she brings back this cat and immediately it is meowing a lot. That\u2019s okay, cats do this when they are in new environments, she\u2019s trying to figure everything out. You can hear her crying down the hall, so of course my RA finds out and tells us we have to move it since it doesn\u2019t have its shots yet and isn\u2019t registered. My roommate says her aunt will come and pick her and the cat up this weekend, and then they can get it it\u2019s shots and get it checked out by a vet. Okay, cool. \n\nWell her aunt now cannot do it. So instead of staying here with the cat to tend to it and take it to it\u2019s vet appointment, she just goes home. She just leaves for the weekend and says \u201c(mutual friend) can keep it in her room, she can have an esa\u201d. My mutual friend was told she was a worst-case-scenario type deal, where the cat would only go to her if roommate couldn\u2019t take the cat home with her. \n\nI stay in mutual friends room so that she isn\u2019t alone with the cat and has some company. We go to bed and the cat begins howling for attention every. Single. Hour. We are constantly being woken up by this little cat. This last night was the second night I had spent with the cat, and she did the same thing the first night. So mutual friend has to get up to go volunteer for a fun run at 6:30 in the morning, and I\u2019m done at this point. I\u2019ve barely gotten any sleep, and I\u2019m exhausted. So I text my roommate and let her know that her cat - which she has owned for a day and then pawned off on me and friend for the weekend so she can go home and relax - won\u2019t stop meowing and that it\u2019s an issue she\u2019ll need to correct if she wants me to continue being her roommate. \n\nMy roommate then hits me with the, \u201cwell we can just drop her back off outside\u201d. Wait, what? You picked this cat up and have owned it for one (1) day and now you want to dump it back outside because it meows? Mutual friend and I both agree that once you take on an animal, that\u2019s your animal and your responsibility, not \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a kitten for a day and then dump it back outside because it\u2019s an animal and meows\u201d. \n\nHere is where we are at. My roommate has adopted this kitten that won\u2019t stop yowling (mutual friend has already gotten complaints from hall residents next to her) and has pawned it off on me and our friend. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m incredibly angry because we have to take care of this cat while roommate goes home and relaxes, and we\u2019re being woken up every hour by the cat. Not her.

English is not my first language, and I'm on mobile. And honestly it's kind of therapeutic to write it all about, so sometimes my thoughts are just unfiltered from thought to paper. \n\nThe title is the gist of my problem. And if it was just that, the answer would be obvious. But we have a two-year old son together. \n\nSo. The story is this. We have been together for a little over five years. We met in college when we both studied there, but I dropped out and got a job when I realised i really didn't want to spend the rest of my life in an office. Almost three and a half years ago my ex got pregnant, and we were both overjoyed. Our sex life tapered off during the pregnancy, because she said she wasn't comfortable in her body any more, and it didn't pick up aftwe our son was born, because she said she was afraid of getting pregnant again (we used protection of course). When our son was born we decided she would be a stay at home mom, and I would support us. At the same time she has always wanted to build a house by herself, so we saved money for that as well. I got a job as a dock worker, which meant I made a lot of money, but I had long hours and overtime was mostly warned on the same day. So I worked a lot. Normally around 50 hours a week, but sometimes as much as 70. \n\nWhen our son was 1, we moved across the country to be closer to her family (we're in Denmark, so it's not as far as it sounds) and started building this house. Or I did. After we moved, I got an apprenticeship as a carpenter, which I still love, but it meant that I was the one doing the lions share of the work on this house. And I did it mostly during my free time while working a full time job. We still weren't intimate very often, because she said she was still afraid of getting pregnant. \n\nFast forward to this summer. Our son is 2,5 years old and goes to kindergarten, and she gets a job. We're both really excited. Both because she was beginning to get cabin fever, and because it would be nice to have a little extra money. Well at work she meets this guy. She starts going out drinking with coworkers after they get off. It's fine, she needs to get out and I support her and tell her it's fine. And it really is\n\nBut I get suspicious. She's comes home and tells me she's getting massages from this guy, and how funny he is. At the same time she is working a lot, so I almost never see her, and I am at home taking care of our son and all the house work. \n\nIt all comes to a head in late August. I have been telling her for a couple of weeks, that I'm worried about this guy, and that I feel like we're drifting further apart. She tells me to stop being paranoid, and that I'm just an idiot for not supporting her going out more, and that I just want her to stay home. I tell her that I just want to see her, and be a couple, and that I'd really like to go out with her as well.\n\nShe works late Thursday and Friday, and afterwards goes for drinks with her coworkers. Saturday she has a work party for all the departments at her store and Sunday she works till five again. After our son is put to bed she goes for a walk with our dog. She leaves around 19.15. I text with her when she's walking, and all seems good. And then she stops answering at about 20.15. And I am worried, texting her if she is alright, because she is usually afraid of the dark. No answer. When she gets back at around 22.30 she just goes to bed saying she's tired. I then see her phone light up with a snap from this guy at work. I let my curiosity get the better of me and open it. He says it was really nice to see her with a bunch of hearts. I am pissed. She's already asleep, so I go on a long walk, get drunk and sleep on the couch. The next morning I confront her and she still claims he's just a friend. I semi believe her, but there is nothing I can really do about it, but I'm really stressed out. \n\nWhat follows is the second worst week of my life.  Monday, she is out for drinks with her coworkers again, Tuesday we fight because I say I'm really worried and I just want to see her, and she tells me to stop being paranoid again. At this point I'm really doubting if what she says is true, and that I'm just jealous and possessive. Wednesday is all right. I make a nice dinner with some wine, and we play board games after our son is asleep. She just really isn't into it, and doesn't really try to participate in our conversation, claimimg she is tired. Thursday she is out for drinks again, and Friday me and my son are going to my parents for the weekend. She can't come because she has another work party on Saturday, this time l my for her deparrment. On Friday she didn't want to walk the 10 minutes to the train to see us off, something she always does, despite not having seen either of us for most of the previous week. This week I hardly sleep and eat, because I'm so stressed out. I start smoking again, and is just all around a mess.\n\nSo she has made plans with this guy, both Friday evening and Saturday. She tells me this and I say okay this, to not seems possessive. I just tell her, I don't want him staying the night. She says she's okay with this and we leave. Friday night I say good night to her around 23.00 and asks if he is still there. He is. So I really don't get much sleep that night either. I wake up at 5.30 and see on the Snapchat map that she hasn't been snapping anyone since I talked to her last, and they always snap each other goodnight. So I freak out, take my parents car and race home in record time. And lo and behold. There he is, sitting on my bed. \n\nShe says nothing happened, that he didn't want to go home, even after she said he had to, and that they just slept, nothing more. I don't really believe her, but after a long fight I go home to my parents again, since our son is still there. I tell her to text me in the evening when she's going home after the party. But around 23.30 she calls me and tells me her phone is out of power, and that she is going home soon. So I tell her to call me when she gets home and gets it in a charger. She doesn't. So the next morning I call her every ten minutes untill I her phone gets turned on, and then I video call her. She is not home. \n\nWhen I get home Sunday evening she admits to the cheating. He tried to kiss her after the party the Saturday before, but she turned him away. She did kiss him on the walk on Sunday evening, and every day at work and when she was our for drinks the whole week. I am crushed. And pissed. There is no yelling, because I am so fucking exhausted and crushed. We have been together for five years, have a son together, we're building a house together and she wants to throw that all away for a guy she has known for a little over a month and a half. \n\nI tell her I am willing to move past this and try to repair our relationship, for our sons sake. And mine. I really do still love her. She says she isn't sure what she wants. She says she fell out of love with me, even before we had our son, and just stayed with me because it was safe, and I provided for her. So as stupid as I am, she gets the week to decide. This is then the worst week of my life. I bend over backwards to juggle my job, our son, all housework and tries to make it perfect for when she gets home. To show her how much our relationship means to me. All the while I'm barely eating or sleeping. \n\nAnd she decides to go with the other guy. We're in mid September by this point, and still living together. So now that she is broken up with me, she goes out every night that she can with this guy. We decided to 'split' custody of our son equally so that we each have a week to be responsible for being home in the evening with him. And she takes him to kindergarten, and I pick him up. \n\nBut when I'm out, she has this fucking guy come over and they're having sex everywhere in the apartment. I haven't sat in my own couch, or slept in my own bed for three weeks because they had sex in it, and I can't stand the thought of even touching them. \n\nI feel like she has no respect for how I feel. I feel so disgusting for even being in the apartment, and so devastated thinking about the woman I love, and I still do love her in some way, just being with this other guy all around my home! She's pretty sure she is pregnant with his child, because they have been having unprotected sex all this time. \n\nSo finally. My question. She hurt me. She hurt me bad. Not just the cheating. But the fact that she continued the relationship for three years without ever communicating to me that she was missing something, the fact that I moved away from all my family and friends for her sake, the fact that I spend all my hard earned savings on a house that I will never live in, the fact that I missed out on a large part of my son's life to make sure the dreams we had could come true. \n\nAnd after this she still wants us to be friends. She says I'm her best friend, and that she doesn't want to lose me. But I can't stand the thought that she can treat me like this and do it without any consequences. But we have to stay friends, right? We have a son together and we need to work together for his sake, so that he has the best life possible. And I want him to have that. It's the most important thing! I just don't know how to reconcile these two feelings... \n\nI'm moving out in four days, and I'm hoping some distance and time will help...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2149202, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So my (27m) now ex-gf (26f) cheated on me and wants to start friends.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572287525, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnb725/so_my_27m_now_exgf_26f_cheated_on_me_and_wants_to/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yeshh125", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4edldjhg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572072634, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnacc6/my23f_boyfriend_24m_missed_my_dance_rehearsal_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dnacc6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 263, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnacc6/my23f_boyfriend_24m_missed_my_dance_rehearsal_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1572072636, "score": 1058, "selftext": "Should I be angry?

I've been reading this forum for about a year. Taking things in and educating myself. Sometime the stories were hard to read. But, I began to see some of the tell tale signs of cheating in my own relationship. Hiding the phone, turning down the brightness, lots of red emoji's being sent. Conversations quickly erased after reading. Other conversations going on at all hours of the night usually after I had gone to sleep. I decided to check the phone logs, 3K messages and 190 mins of talk. Talking after I went to bed,  and on her way home from work for a 1/2 hour every day. I watched and gathered data. When I confronted her,  I got the classic \"He's just a childhood friend.\" excuse but if it bothers you I'll stop talking to him. No. You just tried to hide it better. Messaging inside games and apps, and always the 1/2 hour conversation on the way home.   \nShe flew home to San Diego to take care of her Mom, which just happens to be where he is. Surprise surprise when I picked her up at the airport she announced she was moving home to take care of her Mom.  But, I'll be back when its all over.  /:-| No you won't I'm not nearly as stupid as you think I am. She packed up every single thing in the house that we accumulated over five years. I mean everything. Packed it in a POD, that will take five weeks to get to San Diego.   More stuff than will ever fit in a 8x10 room at her moms place but enough for a new home or a shared residence. I said, This is not a temporary thing this is permanent and this is  feels like a breakup quit jerking my chain and tell the truth. Nope she insisted it is temporary. After she drove to SD and arrived I cancelled her vehicle insurance and transferred her phone billing back to her. She blocked me on FB and told one of her friends that it indeed is a permanent move.   \nThings were already going to shit and I was already to ask her to move out. So this just accelerated things.  I'm not even that upset by it because, thanks to this forum, I saw the signs, knew the excuses and how she would attempt to gas light me. I was ready for it. But, it's more the frustration of \"Sunk cost fallacy\" and the lies right to my face like I don't already  know the truth.    \nSo today, her Dad and I (we get along great)  spent last night drinking and today removing the feminine influence from my house and returning it to it's former man cave glory.  Sure I lost a fiance'  and her son, but I didn't gain an ex-wife and I didn't end up with an alimony check.   \nTL;DR Long time lurker saw the signs of cheating thanks to this forum, GF tried gas lighting me which I was also ready for thanks to this forum.

I've browsed Reddit for so long, but never posted anything. This is real. I'm being honest.\n\nI don't actually expect anyone to read this, but posting this somehow makes me feel like I'm getting it off my chest.\n\nI've been pretty depressed for a while now. Woe is me and all that, and yes I've tried to change it, but still I feel like this. I started going to the gym 4+ times a week, I started drawing again, I've been more social, etc.\n\nI'm just really tired. I know everyone gets sad, and no one's life is perfect, but lately I've felt deeper despair than ever before. I've been having some persistent suicidal ideation lately.\n\nSo, there's this girl at work. She is so f***ing beautiful. The way she is, her hobbies, interests, just everything is great. She is kind, helpful, caring, funny, and all around just great. She is so cutely shy, but I catch those smiles. I'm not out of touch enough to think there could ever be an \"us\". For one, she has a boyfriend. If she is happy, they make each other happy, and treat each other good, I would never want to get in their way.\nThat's not me.\n\nIt's just making me think, \"What if I met someone like that, who was single and interested in me\"?\n\nI've always thought I was a pretty good looking dude. I can make people laugh easily. I genuinely care about others. I'm loyal and honest. Everyone has their flaws, and I have mine, but I would never want to hurt, use, manipulate, or harm anyone. I also don't just want someone \"for\" me, I want to be good for them too. I would never lean to hard on them, use them as a support, or expect them to carry any baggage. I want to be really good for them. To make their life better if I can.\n\nI say that, but lately I've been really beating myself up, almost unconsciously. I feel ugly, unlovable, and like no one would ever care for me. Why would they?\n\nI know, I'm whining a lot. I need to get this out though. No one's is going to read this, but it's almost like screaming it from a mountainside.\n\nIf I was going to find someone like that, this isn't who they deserve. I want to be the best version of me that I can be. How can I expect someone like her, with nothing to give? I need to show them and myself that I am capable of this.\n\nI guess that was a long winded way of saying that I've been really sad and lonely for a long time, and I found something that takes a part of that a way. Something to work towards, to look forward to.\n\nI'm still struggling and I'm still feeling really alone. It's just now, I see something worth sticking around for.

But we haven't done like, anything further than just go on some dates and briefly kiss hello and goodbye and stuff. We haven't actually made out or anything yet.\n\nI decided I wanted to try to progress things a little farther, so I tried to hold his hand when we went for a walk last night, but as soon as i grabbed it, he sort of asked in a teasing kind of tone \"what exactly are you doing?\", and I laughed it off and kept holding his hand and he seemed to take it comfortably after like two minutes. But to be honest, I was already kind of shy about it to begin with, so his teasing kind of made me self conscious that maybe I did something that wasn't welcome?

I\u2019m the eldest, I have a 19yo half brother and a younger 12 year old half brother.

He\u2019s obviously pretty smitten with her and they\u2019ve been spending a lot of time together, but in this process it\u2019s come to my attention that he\u2019s been going to stay with her while leaving my 12 year old brother at home alone overnight. \n\nHis dad had planned to go away for the weekend  with his new girlfriend, and asked me to come up and \u201cbabysit\u201d. Of course I said yes and came up this afternoon ready to have a fun packed weekend, only to discover he went away yesterday and had left my brother yesterday. With only some cheese, bread and doughnuts left in the house for him to eat. After asking my brother I realised that this is likely not a one-off occurrence. \n\nI\u2019m livid to say the least!

I was and still am devastated and disgusted by what he did. I haven\u2019t wanted him to touch me and obviously things are not normal at home.

I think I want to try and fix our marriage but I\u2019m still working through a lot of emotions. Every time we talk he keeps stating he wants to fix it, any way he can. He will do whatever I want, he will be more attentive, pick up more chores around the house, show how important I am to him. He scheduled a marriage counseling appointment for Tuesday. \n\nLast night, we were talking about all this and something about the conversation really upset me and i told him I couldn\u2019t talk to him anymore because I was too mad.

When I asked what he meant, he said he is more likely to let things go and move on. He forgets I\u2019m not that type of person. He said if the situations were reversed, he would be able to move past it by now. Now he says he doesn\u2019t know if he should just give up trying because I\u2019m gonna leave him anyway. He said he thinks I will always hold this over his head and never get past it. IT HAS BEEN SIX DAYS!! Am I really supposed to get over the biggest betrayal of our marriage in six days?! Is this not a normal amount of time to grieve the marriage and relationship I thought we had. Should I be doing something more to show him that I want to work on this? I don\u2019t yell at him, I try not to call him names, I am civil and don\u2019t take cheap shots at him when we talk. However, I do explain to him that I\u2019m angry, sad, shocked, and all the other emotions that go along with your spouse having an affair. But, I\u2019m not over it and I think he\u2019s getting tired of hearing about it. Any advice about the situation is welcome. My main question is about the normalcy of my reaction, should I be getting over this quicker? Is it even worth it at this point? \n\nTl;dr Caught my (33F) husband (33M) cheating six days ago. He can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not over this yet and is now thinking of giving up. Am I normal because I\u2019m still working through these feelings?

We had both been drinking and she fell asleep basically immediately. I was still awake however and saw one of her friends texted her asking if she was home safe. In previous situations where roles have been reversed we\u2019ve texted friends the other is safe so this isn\u2019t unusual. Me, drunk, as I tried to reply to the friend she was home safe with me accidentally scrolled wayyyyy up and saw old messages with her. I shouldn\u2019t have done it, but again being drunk and curious and them being literally in front of me, I read them. Basically when me and my now GF were first hooking up and not exclusive she had gotten with someone else. Whatever. She had let it slip what happened to me in person with me, so I kinda knew and made it seem like basically she was extremely drunk and threw up on the kids bed but also said \u201cI\u2019m not even sure we had sex I was that drunk\u201d. As I\u2019m reading the messages I see she wrote to her friend at the time \u201cjust got with (insert hookups name). Threw up on his bed, but he fucked me right after I felt better. Best hookup and sex of my life.\u201d Her friend replies \u201cawwww. But good for you. And make sure you\u2019re done with (my name) now too\u201d. My gf responded \u201cyeah he texted me last night to hang and I didn\u2019t even respond to him\u201d. Then it goes into how she made stuff for him cause she was pledging a sorority at the time and the sorority did that sort of thing with that fraternity. It seems somewhat clear from the messages she very clearly preferred this guy and I was the backup because it seems like for whatever reason, this guy had no desire or intention of hooking up with her again. I know the guy and to be honest he\u2019s better looking than me and ripped, and honestly I feel kinda inferior to him, as crappy as that may sound. I know some might say \u201cohhh well she chose you in the long run so she prefers you\u201d but frankly I almost don\u2019t feel that way.

Before I start on why I feel she is being unfair I want to give a bit a backstory before my sister moved in with us. My GF owns the house, I moved in with her and her daughter but before I moved in she had her sister living with her (18). I would visit and spend every weekend at her place. My GF would always complain about her sister not helping with anything around the house and I would notice that her sister never does anything to help her clean, look after her daughter, etc... My GF is a sweetheart and too kind for her own good at times so I felt bad that her sister was being ungrateful while my GF works her butt off to support her daughter and also basically support her sister as well. So I told my GF about being more assertive and tell her sister to help out, she's grown enough to know if the house needs to be cleaned, just some sweeping here and there or at least make sure her daughter eats after she gets home from school since she works during the day and her sister is home. Her sister stays in her bedroom all day only to come out and cook for herself not even for my GF's daughter and would only do things to help out if my GF does a favor for her in return. I kept telling my GF that she shouldn't have to put up with it and that she should ask her sister to clean and do stuff around the house because when my GF gets home she's exhausted from working but still comes to clean, cook, and I just felt bad for her having to do so much when her sister is literally sitting at home doing nothing. I mentioned this a few times and my GF got upset with me basically feeling that I was talking bad about her sister but all I was trying to say is that she should have her sister help out more since she is living there for free and my GF pays for everything she does and how she treats my GF in return.\n\nNow, before my sister moved in, we did discuss what chores were to be split between her daughter and my sister and general house rules. My GF hates messes, leaving dishes in the sink, not cleaning up after eating, just general cleanliness. issues. I work from home pretty much all week so I see how things are and I help clean up and cook for the kids when I'm not swamped with work.  I get that her daughter is 14 but she leaves cups on the dining table for days after eating and I generally just pick up after the kids but there have been times I purposely waited to see how long my GF will notice and she won't say anything till days later but if my sister leaves a cup in the kitchen by the water dispenser my GF will mention it to me right away. Another thing, the girls are not allowed to eat in their rooms, my sister had chips once in her room and my GF mentioned to me to remind her the rule but her daughter eats in her room all the time and I don't hear any complaints. Also the reason why we no longer have cups or some of her plates and bowls have gone missing is because I caught her daughter throwing out cups and dishes when she was asked to clean her room. Her daughter put them in a box to be recycled and I was cleaning the indoor porch and upon taking out the stuff to be recycled, I opened this box that felt unusually heavy and saw unwashed food crusted bowls and cups that she didn't want to wash so she just decided to throw it out and hope her mom doesn't notice. \n\nWe also have a small dog which they already had before I moved in that her daughter wanted and swore to her mom that she would take care of but it has been me who has been taking care of him. My GF recently changed the chores to where my sister is to take care of the dog, feed it and take it out once in the morning before she goes to school, when she gets home from school and before she goes to bed and her daughter will be in charge of emptying and taking the trash out from the bathroom and kitchen to the trash can that is outside on the indoor porch. Before these changes, her daughter was in charge of taking the dog out in the morning before school and my sister would take him out after school. These chores were in place for about a week, my GF would come home from work everyday and always ask did my sister take out the dog when she got home from school to which I reply yes since I work from home and I witness my sister taking the dog out and feeding him. Yet she doesn't mentioned anything to her daughter to empty and take out the trash that is full in the bathroom for days in which I wanted to wait and see how long she will let her daughter slide since she's been on my case about my sister all week. \n\nSo fast forward to yesterday, I had to go into the office for work during the day and as I was on my way home my GF sent me a screen shot of a conversation she had with her daughter basically telling her that my sister doesn't clean up after herself and that there was no food for the dog and all these other things. This didn't sit well with me because I work from home basically all the time having to go into the office maybe once or twice a month and I pick up after the girls especially her daughter and I never mention anything to her because that's how kids are they forget or they get distracted. I did have an issue with her daughter accusing my sister of not feeding the dog because when I or my sister feed the dog we don't just fill the dog bowl to the brim and leave it out all day, we actually portion out his food so that he actually eats it all and the food just doesn't sit out. So my GF proceeds to tell me that from now on her daughter will be in charge of the dog and for me to  just tell my sister to clean and take out the trash and that I need to ask my sister to clean more and stop doing things for her because what's the point of having the kids around and they don't do anything, like dolls. This comment made me feel some type of way because as I mentioned in the backstory with her own sister, she just put up with her shit but she would say this to me in regards to my sister. \n\nWhen I got home I asked to speak to my GF in private about the conversation she and her daughter had. I told her I don't want any issues with having my sister live with us, I understand that it's her house and I don't want her or her daughter to feel that my sister and I don't respect it as if it was our own home. Then I tried to have a conversation with her about the things her daughter said about my sister not doing this and that which I strongly feel is the kettle calling the pot black but she just snapped when I mentioned that I work from home and these things aren't just my sister's doing, I pick up after both of them often and I always tell my sister to clean up after herself and often have told her to clean up after her daughter as well without mentioning anything so if this is an issue than both girls need to be addressed. My GF mentioned how she felt my sister isn't taking care of the dog because there was one night that my sister didn't take the dog out to pee but I was just like it was raining hard that night and the dog didn't want to go out to pee what do you want her to do? There have been many times when you asked your daughter when it was her responsibility to take out the dog and her response was it was raining and you just let it go.  She instantly took it as I was attacking her daughter, which I'm not surprised because she has acted this way in the past whenever I try to mention anything about her daughter. She just yells at me and says you always had issues with my daughter and started to bring up all sorts of irrelevant things to the conversation in why she believes I don't like her daughter. This is another issue in our relationship in which I feel her daughter knows how to manipulate my GF's feelings towards me because it was just them two for a long time and my GF has done everything to raise this girl on her own which I praise her for but it is affecting us because anything her daughter says she will not hear me out and I have not done anything to wrong her or her daughter. For the most part I feel her daughter and I get along great, I help her where I can and I'm not trying to overstep my boundaries in trying to parent her in any way, all I ask is that she respects me as the person her mother chose to be with I don't expect her to allow me to be a parent. My GF has an extremely traumatic past that I know affects how she perceives things and it gets extremely difficult to get her to understand things the way I meant it and not how she interprets it. I understand that my GF feels that her daughter saved her life during her most difficult times but at the same time I want her to understand that she saved her daughter as well. I mentioned to her many of times that I know that my place in her life is after her daughter but for her to understand that I would not ever put her in a position that she will have to choose between her daughter and I because I already know that I certainly will lose. I love and care for them both wholeheartedly, I know I'm the adult but I can't help but feel her daughter gives her mother fake feelings to validate certain situations in her favor because she knows how her mother will always put her first in which I understand but I just need for my GF to not feel attacked when there is anything involving her daughter. \n\nSo I don't know how else to approach my GF without her feeling like I'm pointing fingers back at her daughter for saying all these things about my sister. It has been hard since my mother's passing for my sister and I understand my sister's anger when I mentioned this to her. I don't want this to manifest into something more than what it is, I just don't think it's fair how my GF takes her daughter's words over mine when I'm the adult and I'm home to observe both of them daily and the one day I'm not home this all unravels. With moving and adjusting to a new place and the dramatic changes so suddenly in my sister's life, I don't want her to feel she doesn't have a place where she can call home now that my mom has passed. My GF feels this is not a big issue which I agree as far as the kids doing their chores as assigned, but I don't think she understands the weight of how she says things to me and why I feel the way that I do when I have mentioned these things to her in the past about her own sister and she felt some type of way about it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2146719, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (33M) recently got custody of my sister(16) after my mother's death, living with GF (33) and her daughter (14).

She was very clear in saying she wanted to hold off on all physical aspects until we got to know each other much better. We have had some amazing dates, going for strolls, trying new restaurants and enjoying our time together. Things have been going great, I'm not even kidding. It's been amazing. I've found dating to be really tough as you get older and people that are single are sometimes single for a reason, but she's so easy going, doesn't sweat the small stuff and is someone you can just easily talk to for long periods. I was never the kind of person who could talk on the phone for prolonged periods of time, but I find myself chatting with her for a long time. Things have been seriously amazing. \n\nThen the other shoe dropped. We had an amazing date where we met up after work, strolled around the downtown and window shopped, snacked, had a delicious dinner and basically laughed and joked for hours. It was amazing. By the time I get home I see I have a text telling me to check my email then call her, it's important. I see there's an attachment, which is photos of her and a young girl. I start reading and she says she wants to be completely honest and tell me the truth. She has a 7 year old daughter and explained the background, that her biological father is not in the picture (his choice) and that she is reticent to say anything when dating because it often 'ends' the relationship but won't become physical with someone until they know. She has me not to respond if I needed time. I called her anyway and it was INCREDIBLY awkward.  \n\nI'm only really now building my career experience - I did a five year engineering degree and went to graduate school, so I have about 4 years of professional experience. I'm working a lot, trying to save money and generally pretty busy, so relationships were something that I felt important (I really longed for a partner in crime) but I'm really not at all sure I'm ready for the responsibility that would come with a child that's already 7. I don't know how kids operate, I've never been there for a young child and to suddenly date someone with a kid who is smart enough to order movies by themselves kind of freaks me out. \n\nI told her it was totally cool and said that I would have preferred to know early, but I'm really not sure how the hell I feel. I called my mother, of all people, and she said that I need to really think about where I see the relationship going. The fact is, I don't know. I know my mother doesn't want to influence me one way or another and I totally get her position, but I need advice. \n\nI'm not sure what to do, or even how to approach this with her. It did not seem like she expected me to take over the role of father, or even introduce us yet (phew!) but she wanted me to know this person existed and so that we could be on the same page.

We became friends but he slowly began to change into a mean, unpleasant, and now genuinely scary person. I want to cut him out of my life, but I don't know how. (warning, a bit long)\n\nThree years ago, I moved to a new country where English (my first language) is not the primary language. For ease of explanation, let's assume I moved to Greece.  I spoke \"Greek\" upon my arrival, but with an accent and I would make frequent errors, because I was used to the language taught in school, not the way people speak on an every-day basis. As such, for the first few months after my arrival, I was incredibly shy and had a hard time going out and meeting people. I signed up for Tinder, not to go on dates, but just as a way to talk to people in Greek in a very low-stakes way.  I ended up finding another anglophone, and was very excited to be able to talk to someone about the expat experience. We met up and had a great time chatting and getting to know each other. I'll call him Rob. I made it clear from the beginning that I had no interest in a relationship or sexual encounter with him, as I was new to the country and just wanted to make friends (it's very lonely moving to a country where your grasp of the language is mediocre and you don't have any friends or family with you\u2026). Rob was totally fine with this, and we continued to hang out fairly regularly.\n\nRob is in a sort of \"neo-grunge\" band (basically they just sound like Nirvana) and introduced me to his band-mates and their girlfriends. I began to integrate into this group, and it was honestly great. We would go to bars together, hang out, get food late at night, and best of all -- we would all speak Greek together, and I could see that I was improving a lot. Our friendship went on for about 2 months without a hitch.\n\nA few weeks after I met Rob, I ended up meeting my now-fianc\u00e9, Jack (28M at the time, 31 currently), at a concert. I had only been in the country for a little over a month at that point and wasn't feeling stable enough to start dating, but it really was love at first sight. I tried to take things slow with Jack as a result, but that didn't work out very well. After a few months we became pretty much inseparable. And it was around this point that things started to take a turn for the worse.\n\nI would have liked to believe that with all the good things happening -- I was starting to feel properly settled into my new life, I had a friend group, an amazing boyfriend, I was making leaps and bounds in my grasp of the language -- that my life was going to be great. But the more time Jack and I spent together, the more Rob began to make little negative remarks here and there. It was never enough to cause a fight, but it did get me to put my guard up more around him. I would mention Jack less around Rob and co, because I didn't want to cause drama. Jack and Rob hadn't met, as Jack lived outside the city and worked during the week. Rob and I would usually see each other on occasional weeknights, since we lived closer, and I would spend the weekends with Jack.\n\nThen a few months later, Rob met a girl. Things got a lot better after this -- the weird comments (that I chalked up to some kind of jealousy) stopped. We saw each other a lot less frequently, but I really didn't mind, as I was making other friends now as well, and spending more time with Jack. So we grew apart a bit, but that was fine with me.\n\nHis relationship lasted maybe 8 months or so. After they broke up, we saw each other slightly more, but still not as much as at the beginning. And at this point, things slowly started getting weird. He would make bizarre, fatalistic comments when he was drunk (saying things like he \"knew\" he was going to die soon, and when I rightfully was concerned and asked how he knew that, he wouldn't elaborate, just say that he \"knew\" ; saying that he wanted people to refer to him as \"the preacher\" because he knows the truth about things and he alone can teach people; saying he had a fatal disease, then never mentioning it again, and never seeing a doctor), and the unnecessary and rude comments about Jack started up again as well.\n\nIt came to a head one night when we were at a bar. It was getting late, and Rob mentioned that he might miss his last bus home, and he wanted to just stay in my apartment instead of getting the bus. At the beginning of the night, I made it very clear to him that I wasn't okay with him staying in my apartment, as I only had a single bed and no couch. This was something Jack and I had recently discussed and agreed upon. So I told Rob (again) that he couldn't stay with me, and that if he was going to miss his bus he had better leave soon or find somewhere else to stay because, as I mentioned before, Jack wasn't okay with him sleeping in my bed. Rob then snapped at me that **\"Jack doesn't give a shit about you, he just thinks of you as some temporary wh\\*re.\"**\n\nI was so disgusted and offended that I turned around and walked straight out. I didn't say bye, I didn't finish my drink, I just left and went home. I don't know if he ended up getting his bus or if he stayed with someone else. After that, we didn't talk again for a long time.\n\nWe still had each other as friends on facebook. From that point until now, most of our interaction was limited to liking pictures, sending each other the occasional meme, and a few brief conversations. In the meantime, I had moved in with Jack (no more awful single-bed apartment!) to a new house, got engaged, and we now lived about a half hour outside the city. When I recently (as of a few months ago) got a new job working in the city, I let everyone know that I would be around more frequently than I had been, and that if anyone wanted to hang out after work, I'd be happy to. Rob wanted to take me up on that offer. I was a bit hesitant at first, but considering how long ago his outburst was, I decided that I would go through with it. I told Jack about it beforehand, and he was okay with it, but did tell me that if Rob tried any nonsense then I shouldn't see him again (obviously).\n\nSo we saw each other again for the first time yesterday. It was a bit awkward at first, because it had been so long. We got a beer, had a chat, and I was honestly thinking things were going well. And then everything just disintegrated. Someone at the bar bumped into Rob and didn't say sorry. A bit of Rob's beer spilled onto his sleeve as a result, and he just absolutely flipped. He jumped up, grabbed the guy by the arm to turn him around (he was facing the opposite direction) and started getting up in his face, asking who he thought he was that he could behave in such a way, that he should be lucky that he wasn't a more violent person or he would be talking with his fists instead, that he should consider this a warning to be more polite in the future. I was honestly terrified, I thought they were going to start fighting right in front of me, but thankfully the other guy remained calm and diffused the situation. When Rob sat back down, he started explaining to me that he did it to teach the guy a lesson, because **\"the next person he bumps into like that might not be as nice as I am\"**. I finished my drink quickly and told him I had to get going.\n\nI don't intend to speak to Rob again after this, my mind is made up on that. But my question is how should I go about removing him from my life? Unfortunately he knows exactly where I work, because he met me outside the building. Do I explicitly tell him I don't want to see him again? Do I ghost him?

Halfway through I realized the video was of my now girlfriend, and she was having sex with her ex boyfriend. The video is of her with her back to the camera the whole time, so only the ex boyfriend and I know who she is. It may seem like I'm reaching here, but I can hear her voice, see her body, and can tell it's her from the way she has sex. I've tried to give myself many reasons as to why it wouldn't be her but I fall short and have watched the video 30 times.\n\nShe does not know this video was posted, as it was posted when we first started dating. I think she knows the video was taken, as the camera is close to the bed and clearly set on a table facing perfectly that way to see the whole shot. The video has been posted on several sites and already has several million views. If she found out, her and her family would be crushed. It would cause serious mental anguish to her, and she already suffers from stress problems. Her name is not associated with the video, you cannot see her face, and there is no way anyone can tell it is her besides myself and her ex. \n\nPart of me believes I should tell her, to give her the information, to be honest and transparent like I always try to be. However the massive stress and embarrassment that would come from this knowledge would be severe. In addition, she would likely be unsuccessful in getting the video removed/lawsuits/other repercussions as I have heard they are extremely hard to get removed. I also know that I want the relief of getting it off my chest. \n\nWhat do you think I should do?

This morning my husband was kissing all over my neck, he told me he\u2019d be gentle and that I just have to lay down. I pleaded with him to just let me be but he wouldn\u2019t. So I told him to wait until tonight, and that I promise I\u2019ll do it then if he just lets me rest. He said \u201calright\u201d. I spent the whole day drinking, I know its bad, but I was hoping to feel numb and disoriented enough to bare it. He came home from work and I really really tried to enjoy it, but it was horribly painful. I was crying, and trying to be silent. He saw the tears on my face and he just wiped them away. He wasn\u2019t being gentle like he said, it was very rough. I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and I put my hand on his arm and said \u201cplease stop\u201d. He just pinned my wrist down. He kept telling me \u201cjust relax\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d. I tried to move away, but he just held me in place. I felt so defeated and exhausted, so I just closed my eyes and tried to imagine other things. When he was done, he kissed me and told me get some rest. I cried myself to sleep.

Weird scenario I know. I've been with my wife for 12 years. Not bad I know. We used to go at it hard all the time every day. Then about 8 years ago it became every second day. Then once a week. Once a month. Once every second month. Once every three months. Once every 6 months. Now it's either only on my birthday or after she does out for a drink with friends. \n\nIt started off innocently enough. The excuses were - I'm too tired. I have work. It's that time of the month (for 2 weeks in a month. She wouldn't be using a pad but say it anyway and sometimes I would see clean pads for days thrown in the trash). Its too late in the evening. Its too eary in thr evening. Morning. I need to get something ready for tomorrow and then she would vanish for a couple of hours. Pretty soon the excuses stopped and she just started dropping to the floor. \n\nThen she started letting go and falling into a heap if I touched her. It was weird. She would just go limp. Or start laughing uncontrollably or crying. Only ever do it with the lights off me on top and in just the one position. No movement from her. When playing with me, which is the only thing she does now on her part that involves movement, it hurts. She grabs it and pulls, pulls it straight off like she's opening a door. Imagine someone grabbing your wrist, pulling it as hard as they can in a jerking motion. Then imagine they let go, your arm falls down to your side. Then they grab your wrist again and give it a hard pull again. I've told her it hurts before and how to hold it tight and firm and move downwards instead of upwards and she takes it as I don't like her so she gets angry and turns away and jumps on her phone. It just so bad the other night I lost my erect as she was playing with it and I think shes doing it on purpose. I said that hurts three times but she kept going. \n\nI can't finish or it takes me 30-40 mins because I straight up feel like I'm raping someone when we do the deed. I'm not stupid and know when someone's turned on. And it's happened once in the last year when she was drunk. She came home after a night out it was like we were young again. That was 6 months ago. \n\nI stopped trying a few months ago. I still do all the other stuff like cooking, cleaning, dinners, flowers, gifts, etc but as soon as I'm done for the day I just switch off and sleep. She noticed and said I was being cold so I started grabbing her innapropriatly in bed again right when she's about to go to sleep. That's seemed to have put her mind at ease and she's become happier. \n\nI'm not cheating on her. I don't do drugs. Smoke. I work hard and bring in a good income. Keep us in a very nice house in a very nice area. I keep fit. I don't go out late or spend money on useless things. \n\nIt's a weird situation and I have no idea what to do next. Her being happy matters the most and she seems happy with what I'm doing now. I'm fine with it. \n\nMy question is, have others found this middle ground you be had to adopt to keep a relationship going?\n\nTL:DR \nWife has rejected advances for 8 years. Husband stopped trying because he can't finish and feels like a rapist. He's found a middle ground by touching her just before she sleeps because he knows she'll tell him to go away. Shes now happy.

I am posting here because I want to know how best to recover my relationship with my team.\n\n-------\n\nI've been on my current team for the last year and few months. So far, everyone's been nice and professional. It's very diverse and high performing, and most of the issues I've had with others were minor annoyances. \n\n#### Background (you can skip this if you want)\n\nDuring the summer, I was put on a huge project as the solo engineer, and was instructed to use some pretty new/cutting edge technology to do so. I work for a pretty large technology company that's known for making new frameworks rather than just adopting them, so what I was using didn't have a ton of external documentation or good tooling yet. I spent the whole summer banging my head against my desk to finish the project, and because of the lack of good software support, there were a couple of date slips. Ultimately though, I delivered what I needed to. Not only that, but I onboarded a bunch of internal teams to the new service and managed the program by myself. Also, other engineers I didn't even know, some from our offices abroad, would message me to help them with this new technology because they saw my code and other documents I'd written.\n\nThe twofold problem that arose was that, because I was working by myself, and because I was working mostly with external engineers, my management and some of the supporting roles in the team didn't always know what I was doing. My manager also went out on a month long vacation during main part of the project. Anyway, while I totally had the opportunity to sync with others more frequently, it didn't cross my mind because I was really busy. Also, the way our team works is that the PMs are supposed to poll the engineers for info and then report it out... which didn't happen. \n\nBasically, for months on end, no one asked me for any information, so I naturally assumed they were reading the statuses I was sending out or were getting info from the other teams.\n\n#### Problem\n\nWhen my manager came back, we had a meeting where he told me that he received a bunch of negative feedback about me while he was gone about how it seemed like I didn't know what was going on and was moving slowly etc. I am usually a calm person but got extremely angry, especially because I'd been sacrificing nights and weekends, days I could have spent with my friends and boyfriend, to pull together this thing that no one else had the capability to help me on. He said he understood I was upset but that because my company stack ranks, I was now on a performance plan. The people who gave the negative feedback included my boss's boss, the product management team, the quality engineering team, and some other engineers.\n\nI went back to my desk and sent him the list of everything that I'd done, all the questions I'd gotten from other teams, and all the positive written feedback I had received - some from people pretty high up.\n\nThe week after... he very bashfully admitted that they'd made a big mistake, but that HR was not giving them guidance on how to reverse it. I was pretty mortified because this project could have helped me get promoted, but now that I'm in this state, I can't get promoted for another year, I can't change teams, and I will be flagged as a low performer for at least a year. \n\nSince then I've just kept my head down and continued to work. Everyone around me has been constantly praising the work I did and will send me links to documents written by other teams that say they're using what I built. They give me shoutouts when it's relevant. But I've just been feeling so sad. It's been affecting me at home, even though my boyfriend has tried to cheer me up. We've talked about my potentially leaving the company, but leaving on a performance plan means you can never be employed by the company again. Plus, I'm on a work visa so things get complicated if I quit without another job lined up.\n\nI cry on my walk to work nearly every day because I feel so heartbroken. But the worst thing is that they seem remorseful, so I feel guilty for feeling negatively. It would have been a much easier decision of they had been horrible about it. I also love my immediate boss - he's so nice and cheerful and dad-like - I just want him to succeed and be happy, and this whole situation looks really bad on him even though he was not the actual person who put me on the plan.\n\nYesterday, I had another meeting with him and he said he had some exciting work scheduled for me in late November (and it really is exciting - think AI type stuff), but I couldn't help but come out and say that I was really unhappy and didn't trust anyone anymore, especially because I was *still on the performance plan*, even though my management said all the stuff I sent them would help them defend me from being fired. My boss went into a panic when I said I was unhappy, but told me that they all believe I'm extremely valuable. He assured me they're going to fix the situation with HR, but it unfortunately takes some time. \n\nI'm so confused about what to do. How can I stop feeling resentful of my team, especially the people who originally gave me poor feedback? I do actually believe they're fighting HR on this, but I'm not even sure if I should hang around to see what happens? Is it worth trying to work through my feelings towards them? This has been a great team otherwise.\n\nI don't want to let my boss down or make him sad. I can't get into it, but he took a huge chance on me when I joined the team, and I'll always be grateful to him.

My wife and I have supported them financially and emotionally at different times.  That's what friends do.\n\nOne BFF local and one is not. The local BFF provided cover for my wife's romantic and sexual affair for several months. The local BFF lied to me directly about it, and when the floodgates began to open up said she was as shocked as anyone and promised to be a confidant who could help counsel us in secret so no one else needed to find out.  I spilled my guts to her about my fears and anxiety with promises of confidentiality and she promptly shared it all with my wife.  I discovered all of this and called them both on it.  My wife begged for forgiveness and immediately took steps to help us heal. Since then (2 years ago), my wife has done everything she can to make amends.  She has been sincere and done everything asked of her to make things better.  I love her dearly and we approaching 3 decades of marriage now with 2 grown children none the wiser.\n\nThe local BFF solicited my wife's other BFF and the two of them attacked me personally.  As my wife and I experienced the natural ups-and-downs of recovery, my wife naturally looked to her friends for support and so they were told everything about how we were taking some steps forward and some back in regaining control of our relationship.  The friends used my insecurity and desire to go to counseling, talk about our issues, etc. as ammunition against me -- saying I was playing the victim and needed to just let things go.  One threatened me personally if I didn't stop talking to my wife about the affair and said I was an awful husband and father.   I confronted them and told them I wanted to make things better among us but that I need them to stop the attacks and apologize for enabling the affair or otherwise making tensions worse through personal attacks. They point blank refused, said I was the problem, and that they will not apologize for just being friends.  There has been no communication now for 2 years, but the tensions remain.\n\nBecause my wife knows this is all her fault, she is reluctant to ask her friends to change in any way.  Through my personal counselor, I have learned to manage my anger about these two and have negotiated a truce whereby these women are not allowed in my home when I am there.  I simply cannot stand the idea of welcoming someone into my home who physically threatens me, thinks their lies and attacks were warranted, and thinks affairs are to just be accepted as part of marriage. This arrangement has been largely successful. It has allowed me to concentrate on my marriage and we are seeing positive results.  However, these two are deeply connected to our extended family and they are always \"around.\"  We have to make convoluted plans to avoid confrontation and they give her an earful about how unreasonable I am to not want them around.  I should just \"let things go.\" I would be lying if I said I am not bitter about how they betrayed our family nearly as much as my wife.  I would also be lying if I didn't say I am bitter about my wife tolerating these women attacking me and our marriage and showing no remorse about it.  \n\nSo 2 years in, here is where I am.  No one really knows about the affair but the BFFs and a couple unrelated folks. Things are the best they have been since D-day, but this is the last major hurdle to finally putting this all behind us.  Things are demonstrably awkward around family. My wife is uncomfortable, I am uncomfortable, and it remains a cloud hanging over the entire extended family dynamic. \n\nI have no idea where to go from here.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2144517, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My(48M) wife (47F) cheated on me and her best friends saw it as an attack opportunity.

I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019re allowed to upload images, so I\u2019m fine with copy-pasting the text here.\n\nMe: Hey! It was great getting to see you last night! Hope you guys enjoy the rest of your trip. So I\u2019ll be honest, I was in the bathroom while you were on the phone, and it sounded like you said something like, \u201cI only have to deal with him for a couple of hours, thank god?\u201d It sounded like you were talking about me; it\u2019s just something that I overheard. Is everything okay between us?\n\nHer: Fuck listen I was just tired from our trip and cranky and was venting to my parents. I realize that isn\u2019t a good enough excuse, so I\u2019ll explain: \n\nthe fact of the matter is you and your brother have very different personalities - meaning that you and I have very different personalities. You are super outgoing and sociable and we\u2019ve seen that you can get along with just about anyone. You thrive on social interaction, you\u2019re very extroverted and it shows, but tbh it comes across to some as intense and incredibly draining, which includes me. The fact of the matter is {/u/HelpMePlsOhMy} I\u2019m very introverted, as is your brother; every time we\u2019ve gone out to see you we\u2019ve always enjoyed our visit, but it had always involved some sort of social/physical activity - going downtown for bar-hopping, going to parties, day at the lake, or hiking or whatever and it\u2019s so draining. And I could start making a point to make my feelings more known instead of getting into a pissy mood whenever I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m really sorry I\u2019ve never mentioned this before and I realize it\u2019s been 8 years that I\u2019ve known you. I\u2019m also really sorry if I\u2019m sounding super bitchy right now. I like you very much and you are an important part of my life it\u2019s just that had I met you out in any other circumstance, and that you had not been {insert my brother\u2019s name} brother, I would have a REALLY hard time getting along with you.\n\nMe: I appreciate your honesty and I\u2019m sorry for how I acted before, but really that\u2019s just how I am. I can do my best to tone it down a little, but it would\u2019ve been nice had you told me this, pretty much after the first few times we met. I\u2019m assuming {insert my brother\u2019s name} knows about how you feel?\n\nHer: Yes he knows but frankly he feels as if it\u2019s not super important. A part of him feels bad for not telling you all those years, but another part of him thinks, \u201cWhat good would come of this? He\u2019s my brother and I love him very much, I\u2019m not going to fucking shun him because he has a different personality from mine. In the grand scheme of things this stuff is so minor.\u201d\n\nSo, what I\u2019m getting at is; it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like me, it\u2019s that she and I have very different personalities, and that can come across as intense. She is right in that I\u2019m very extroverted and my brother is the opposite, and she is, too. I\u2019ve known that for years. In a way I see this as a learning experience for all of us: she\u2019s going to try to be more honest with her feelings, and I\u2019ll try to tone things down a little bit. I still love my brother\u2019s girlfriend like family, even if we have very different personalities.\n\ntl;dr unless I\u2019m misreading something here, it\u2019s not that my brother\u2019s girlfriend doesn\u2019t like me \u2014 but rather, we just have very different personalities?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2144494, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[UPDATE] Just found out that my brother's (28/M) girlfriend (28/F) of 8 years, doesn\u2019t like me, and I\u2019m (24/M) devastated.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572230590, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmlhdn/update_just_found_out_that_my_brothers_28m/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRAmeAwaay", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4upo1k3z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571938722, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmjtgm/update_my_gf_28f_joked_about_male_enlargement/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dmjtgm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 117, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmjtgm/update_my_gf_28f_joked_about_male_enlargement/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571938723, "score": 1604, "selftext": "Dear redditors, see the [original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljukt/my_gf_28f_joked_about_male_enlargement_pills_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nI want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who gave amazing feedback and told me to stay the hell away from those pills, admired my confidence in sharing my penis size, and told me to communicate.

I even told her those damn things could give me a heart attack or worse. She started crying as if I had died and jumped in hugged me super hard and asked me to please forgive her and that she would not want anything to happen to me or put my health in jeopardy.

I planned a big romantic dinner, took her to see a play, and showed her a very nice time.  \n\nAs we got back to my place, I joked that I was glad she was ready because it had been about a year for me.

Apparently my thread blew up after I went to sleep. I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. \n\nRegarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.\n\nThanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day.

Any time I start talking shit about myself he gets upset. The thing is... He makes no effort to tell me he's attracted to me at all or even act like he's attracted to me.\n\nOn top of all that, I feel like he has complete access to everything I say and do online or on my phone and I don't have any access to his stuff. I don't know his passwords, I don't know how to unlock his phone. I had changed my passwords earlier this year as well as my phone security and he pestered me until I gave it to him. If I mention anything to him, he gets upset that I don't trust him.\n\nTyping this all out makes me feel like I've been used and manipulated. I get very little satisfaction from this relationship. I can't honestly talk to him about it because he just gets upset and makes me feel like the crazy bad guy. I have no support system, no one to talk to. All of my friends are also friends with him and I don't want people taking sides and that kind of bullshit.\n\nWe have issues, we have talked about all these issues and yet nothing is ever resolved. I always end up feeling this way, insecure, jealous, paranoid.

Good riddance and from what I heard, the guy broke it off with her back in August. I know this because she left me a couple of voicemails at the time asking to \"talk this through\". I was having none of it, blocked her number and deleted the voicemails. Haven't spoken to her since.\n\nI did call the police regarding the stolen safe the day after making my first post. They were able to make phone contact with her, she told them where she was staying and she did give back the safe with all of the contents. She claimed she just picked it up with what she thought was the rest of her stuff. Impossible but whatever, I was happy to be done with her and I've started dating again.\n\nFast forward to Monday and I received an email stating my credit card statement was ready, for my emergency credit card. The one I almost never use literally at all. I make a purchase on it every six months since I got it 3 years ago and even then, that's just to keep it working and it's always something like a tank of gas.\n\nWhen I looked at the statement I was stunned. Beauty products, fast food, Target (haven't been there in a year), all sorts of things equaling about $2000. Needless to say, I went right back to the police with a printout of the charges and had to dispute the entire thing with the credit card company. They shut off the card and told me it wasn't swiped, it was likely used on an app.\n\nShe copied my credit card number down and started using it. I tried calling her but her phone has been shut off. Gee wonder why.\n\nThought I was done with her but I guess not.

My parents divorced when I was young (4 yo), didn\u2019t have the best relationship with my dad for a number of years because my mom fed me lies growing up about him. I finally grew up saw through those lies and see that he\u2019s one of the most caring people I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. \n\nMy dad dated and lived with this woman (toxic ex -TE)while I was growing up (10ish to 19ish maybe?), as I look back they were just.. not meant to be. Both working low income jobs, living pay-check, using alcohol and drugs, both unstable and fighting all the time. TE had a son around my age and followed in his mother\u2019s footsteps. Eventually both TE and her son  decided to pick up and leave my dad, they moved back to where they grew up which is where she got back with her ex husband and sons father. Mind you this is states away and my dad said he never had a clue she still had feelings for this guy. It broke my dads heart and he chased after her. She told them they were done and that was the end of it.\nTurns out TE and son get into..big trouble to say the least. In and out of Jail a few times, doing HARD drugs and getting into fights. To say I was relieved she was out of my dads life is an understatement. \n\nWithin the 8 years after TE left my dad, my dads whole life and demeanor changed. He got a great job, quit the drugs, has helped his family when others wouldn\u2019t. My dad and I have the best relationship ever now, we talk multiple times a week (I love about 13 hrs away from him) and overall just have a healthier relationship than we ever had. \nFast forward to about 3 years agoTE\u2019s son shows up on my dads doorstep. Literally walked 30 miles from the jail he just got out of and landed on my dads doorstep (again last time we knew he was back in his home state 17 hrs away) My dad took him in to help him get back on his feet. Took about 2.5 years but finally got a job and quit mooching off my dad and just left. No thank you, took some cash and items and skidadled. Haven\u2019t heard a peep from him in about 6 months. \n\nNow I find out last night that a full week ago TE did the exact same thing her son did, showed up out of the blue with her two dogs looking to move in with my dad. NO contact in 5ish years? And just thought she could move in. Which turns out she\u2019s been living there FOR A WEEK. \n\nWhat hurts me the most, is he waited a week to tell me. He ignored my phone calls and texts. For this woman who he\u2019s had no contact with and drug him down. When he called me I didn\u2019t have some very nice things to say, and apparently she was standing next to him thinking I\u2019d be excited she was back in his life?\nWrong. I want to fly down there and tell her to leave and never come back, but.. he\u2019s a grown man and make his own life choices. I just know she will mooch off him, and act like all is fine and dandy. I am so worried my dad will end up turning down the wrong path again because of her, and I told him as much during our conversation. I just don\u2019t want her to tear down what he\u2019s built up for himself for so many years. \n\nThis post turned out to be way longer than expected and if I didn\u2019t bore you, I thank you for reading as I needed to vent.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2143579, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My dad\u2019s toxic ex showed up on his doorstep", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572224050, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmev14/my_dads_toxic_ex_showed_up_on_his_doorstep/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throaway10863", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4v5qai2z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571904984, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmdby9/my_m21_so_f20_made_out_with_another_guy_at_a_party/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dmdby9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 221, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmdby9/my_m21_so_f20_made_out_with_another_guy_at_a_party/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571904985, "score": 346, "selftext": "I've been with with her for 9 month now.

I offered to help her expand it (an offer she jumped on, of course) as I could see it was a good opportunity for our new family and I'm good at that type of thing. \n\nThe more I worked and grew her company, the less she worked (and the more money she spent; travel, restaurants, gifts, jewelry, nanny/housekeeper, etc). We had a baby girl. She barely watches her. It was pathetic, she was staying in bed until noon, up late on social media, drama, drama, drama. The nanny took care of the house and kids. The business was now bringing in $75K per month (before we met she was working full time and it was only bringing in about $10K per month).  And now she's averaging only about 3 days of work per month. \n\nObviously, I addressed the situation with her several times, we had never discussed her not working.. And at this point she starts calling me an abusive SOB (for the record, I was always very kind and supportive of her and her older children, I was never abusive at all in any fashion), and, in hindsight, she was actually very abusive to me.. Verbally, psychologically, physically.. But I was a \"real man\", I could take it, she's not like this all the time, blah, blah, fricking blah.. She cuts me out of the now very successful business. She takes over.. Claims a monkey can do what I do.. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nSoon after this, she files police reports, falsely accusing me of abusing her older daughter.. Police and CFS are involved because of the very serious nature of the false allegations, I have to move out. It takes a year before I can see our younger daughter again.. Court, Police and CFS are satisfied the allegations are false. I'm allowed access. Another false allegation is made, and another, and another, and another.. CFS and police investigations ensue.. All deemed false.. But the kids had to go through multiple interviews with police and CFS. I opened up my home and entire life to them (I had done nothing wrong, I had nothing to hide), they were allowed access to anything they wanted, anytime they wanted, coming by unannounced was fine too.. I drove the investigation forward.. \n\nThey start looking at her now.. Emotional abuse of the kids.. I think what helped me a lot was when they asked me to take a lie detector test and I agreed that I would on the condition that she had to as well. She absolutely refused and they never asked me again.. \n\nSuddenly, she wants to talk about getting back together (I've been hearing that her business has suffered horribly since she took over and she's been blacklisted from many customers, the business is failing fast) and she'd like to come work for me.. My reply was not what she wanted to hear.. \"F**k you!\" \n\nAllegations continue.. All false.. And now CFS realizes it.. CFS seizes the kids from her.. \n\nNow my daughter is with me, full time, mother can't see her without CFS supervision.. Court imposed psych assessment reveals she has a nasty psychological disorder, she must get years of treatment.. Oh well, too bad, so sad.. I'm one of the few guys out there that gets awarded child support.. But, she's on welfare now (in an effort to avoid paying support and to qualify for legal aid, obviously that's in the best interest of the child), quite the difference in lifestyle now though, I suspect..\n\nThere's more, a lot more.. It's even worse for her.. But I can't say much without identifying people involved.. \n\nAny advice on what to watch for in my daughter as she grows? She was quite young when this all went down. How about any advice on what to expect next from my ex?\n\nTLDR - Husband builds wife's business, she stops working, makes false allegations of child abuse and takes business and daughter.

For about a week everything was fine, he was supportive. Last night I told him that I've gained 1 kg (2.5 lbs) since starting treatment (I'm really proud of this!). His first response was \"that's good\", but after a long pause, he said \"can I be honest? I think you're beautiful right now, and if you get bigger I don't know if I would still be attracted to you.\"\n\nWe had a long talk which escalated into an argument. I said that it's not fair for him to want me to maintain an unhealthy weight. He rebuffed me (warning gross)&gt;!he said it wasn't fair that I've been kissing him and giving blowjobs all this time without telling him that I purge my food. He said that's been bothering him since he found out about the ED last week, and now he can't stop checking his breath because he's worried about smelling like vomit.!&lt;Basically his standpoint was that we've both done fucked up things and he would rather be fully honest with me, even if the truth hurts.\n\nI know this is not good. The more I think about it, the more I feel like what he said is not okay, and I'm seriously considering breaking up with him. The bigger issue I have now is that I truly believe there is something wrong with me. All my relationships before my current bf ended badly after I told them about my ED. One ex took it really personally and expected me to get better overnight, and the other one told me \"I love when you get thinner\" and discouraged me from getting help. Now it's happened again. I'm 3 for 3 at this point.\n\nWhy does this keep happening? Can I only be attractive if I'm underweight? Am I just a lost cause? Honestly this whole situation is really breaking me. I haven't been in many relationships, and I get deeply invested each time, only for things to fall apart because of me and my stupid ED. Is it just not possible for me to have a healthy relationship?

My parents divorced when I was 5 and my mother tried on and off to be part of my life. She was a druggy alcoholic and the relationship bridge burned before I got to highschool. \n\nWhen I was 9, my father met his current wife, my new stepmom. She was great for the first few years. Only stress was from my sister who caused many issues due. She was manipulative and had some personality disorders. When my sister was kicked out after highschool, when I was 13, there was a year of peace. Then my stepmom locked on to me.\n\nFrom age 14 to 18, it felt like my mom was looking for every small slip up from me. She would hold things against me for months or even years, she would scream at me at full volume saying how I can't do anything right and constantly getting my head out of my ass. She would throw things in anger, belittle me on how I looked or acted (I'm gay and she is not with that), and just make me feel horrible. Whenever we were in the car, she would always open the windows as if I smelled like shit. She would constantly flick my ear or my glasses because she was \"trying to joke around and be friendly\" if we were in the car. This would always only happen when my dad was away. When he would show up, she would change. She would cry and say how I was causing all this stress on her. \n\nI was terrified to be home. Car rides made me nervous because I couldn't leave. I barely talked and made as little noise as I could.i was scared of my shadow. I counted down the hours until I could be safe and go to sleep. My junior and senior year in highschool, I was highly depressed and suicidal. My mom found out I was self harming my junior year and took me to a doctor for all those pills. They didn't help my soul crushing fear I had of my stepmom though. \n\nWhen college came around, I thought I was free, but I wasn't. I had to email home about how I was doing each week, but my mom treated it like a college essay. If I had any issues in it, she would email back tearing me apart, text me in all caps, or call me, screaming over the phone, threatening to show up. Emails scared me. Phone calls scared me. If I saw her contact pop up, I would have a breakdown. As time went on, she started showing up randomly and demand me to show her everything in my dorm. After 2 years, even more self harm, and way too many close calls on top of a parking lot, I decided I was going to drop pout and move away.\n\nYeah, it's extreme, but I couldn't go home for summer. I was going to kill myself if I did and I say that in all seriousness. I was not going to live another summer with her.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, I called my dad and tried to explain all of this through my crying because I was terrified. I didn't want to let my dad down. I didn't want to be a failure. He didn't take it well. Said a man should be afraid of his own mom. He did say he would work on it, but nothing happened. So I left. I told them 3 days before the semester ended and I left. I gave them my new address and that's it. I didn't even tell them why I left. It hurt too much at the time and it still hurts now. \n\nIt has been 2 years and I have been so much better mentally. There hasn't been much communication between us at all. Today is my birthday and I got a really heartfelt email from my father saying he still loves me and all that. Because of this email, I came to a point where I want to tell him why I left. I want to type up a detailed email of how I felt and what had been happening behind walls. I'm just afraid it would ruin his relationship with his wife that he loves and who makes him incredibly happy. Or he could just hate me instead.

They don't butt into my life, they only give their opinions when I ask.\n\n\nI introduced my girlfriend Tracy on a family trip. In retrospect that was probably a bad idea and I shouldn't have had them spend several days together when they were just meeting for the first time.\n\n\nOne of the first things we did was go to an art exhibit. Tracy saw a portrait of a young girl and called the name \"Amy!\" sounding very shocked. She went over to the painting and told us it was a picture of her friend Amy, who had died as a child. Tracy looked at the name of the artist and said it was Amy's sister. Tracy didn't burst into tears or anything but she did tear up when she talked about Amy, and it was clear she was still affected by Amy's death. Tracy calmed down pretty quickly and I don't remember her mentioning Amy again during the trip.\n\n\nI noticed later that my parents seemed cold towards Tracy. Not rude, and they weren't technically doing anything wrong, but Tracy asked me if they had a problem with her. I said they didn't but I eventually decided that something must be going on, because they are usually much friendlier. I asked my siblings and they thought Tracy was fine and didn't know anything about why our parents didn't like her.\n\n\nI got my parents to admit what their problem was, and it turns out they were convinced that Tracy made the Amy story up and just pretended to get upset at some random painting to get attention. I knew that Tracy had been telling the truth, Tracy had mentioned to me awhile ago that her friend had died when they were young, and the next time we met Tracy's sister after the trip Tracy talked about seeing the painting and her sister responded as if she already knew about Amy. She teared up a little at both these other times when she discussed Amy, and I think it's genuine. Even without that additional info, I never would have assumed Tracy made this all up.\n\n\nMy parents did apologize to me, but I was pretty mad that any of this happened in the first place. I have no idea why they thought Tracy was lying, seeing the painting was a big coincidence but having a childhood friend die isn't that unlikely. My parents could have at least taken Tracy's word for it and only become suspicious if she was constantly telling outlandish stories.\n\n\nI got really upset at my parents because even though they apologized, they didn't acknowledge how weird their assumption was and made it seem like they were sorry for being wrong, but that this was a reasonable assumption with the information they had. I didn't think this was reasonable at all and we got into an argument, with me asking \"are you dumb? What were you thinking??\"\n\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this now. My parents at least realized they were in the wrong and will treat Tracy better, but I don't know what else I need to do to make this right. Normally I would want to be honest with Tracy and tell her what happened, but I'm worried that knowing the truth might actually be more hurtful to her. It's clear that Amy is a sensitive subject. Ideally I would want my parents to apologize to Tracy but since they're convinced that their assumption was reasonable I don't know if that's going to happen.

Sometimes they're not...dry. I find them after he leaves and because I have light sheets it's kind of obvious.

It's only happened a couple of times in our entire relationship but I hate having to scope out my sheets every time he's in my bed (even if we aren't intimate he doesn't wear boxers or anything) and then having to clean my sheets.

I also wanted children, and I had admitted to her that that\u2019s what would make or break a relationship for me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what went wrong, or why she has decided to tell me months before our wedding, but she told me yesterday that she thought about it, and she doesn\u2019t want children after all. I told her that she knew me having children is a requirement, and that it\u2019s not something I\u2019m willing to negotiate. She told me that I\u2019m putting imaginary children before her, and that I must not love her for her if I\u2019m considering breaking off our marriage and going our separate ways. I understand that if she changed her mind there\u2019s nothing I could do about it, but this absolutely will not work for me, and I\u2019m willing to leave her for it.

He has been friends with his best friend for a few years before he met me, and they have a very close relationship which I was initially very supportive of. However, from observing over the years I have realized there is more to the relationship than I initially believed. \n\nI know it is wrong to assume people\u2019s sexuality, but I am almost 100% sure his best friend is attracted to men (or at the very least, my boyfriend). This wouldn\u2019t be a problem normally, except he has begun to blatantly disrespect my relationship and overstep boundaries. He has always been fairly cold to me, even though I went out of my way to form a friendship with him. However, recently, he has been going overboard. \n\nWhen my boyfriend and I schedule time together which is rare due to our busy schedules, his best friend frequently asks him to cancel and do something with him instead. He is very physically affectionate with my boyfriend (which my boyfriend does not reciprocate), and uses pet names for him which are normally reserved for a relationship. He also makes frequent \u201cjokes\u201d about being gay, my boyfriend being attractive, how my boyfriend should try dating a guy instead of me since women are difficult, etc. \n\nIf my boyfriend and I argue about anything, he pushes for us to break up. He has pointed out before that he is more of a constant in my boyfriend\u2019s life than I am. He is very possessive over my boyfriend, and frequently makes comments to me about how much time they used to spend together/how close they were in a very passive aggressive manner. I consistently get the impression that he accuses me of \u201cstealing away\u201d my boyfriend.\n\nNow that our relationship has progressed further and we are getting serious, his friend has gotten worse as my boyfriend directs most of his attention to me. He is borderline hostile to me and outwardly hits on my boyfriend in a smug manner, and my boyfriend allows it because he insists his friend is straight. He asked my boyfriend to schedule his semester around his classes instead of mine, which is obnoxious. He asks him to leave dates early, invites him over for \u201cdates\u201d to watch shows, splits costs with him for things my boyfriend is going to buy so they have to be together to use them (textbooks, games, etc). \n\nI just feel so incredibly disrespected. I am not a jealous or vindictive person. I truly wanted to be friends with his best friend, and I had no negative opinions of him until he made his behavior clear once he realized I am not a temporary thing. I do not feel threatened, my partner has never shown signs of wanting to be with anyone else and is assuredly straight. My boyfriend was single his whole life until he met me and I intend to stay. I am at my wits end\u2014 I don\u2019t know what to do about his best friend. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t bother my boyfriend I feel like I should leave it alone, but I feel like it has crossed a line and I need my boyfriend to realize what I (and some of his friends) have noticed. I have no issue with them remaining friends as long as his friend accepts that\u2019s all they\u2019ll ever be. It makes me feel crazy to be \u201cjealous\u201d of a man.

So i recently got out of a long relationship, for reasons i won't go into here, but it's all still very fresh in my mind. Shortly after that, i met a girl at my university, she seemed cool, she asked me to hang out, we did, and she tried to kiss me. Immediately i told her i'm really not ready for a relationship, and i'm not into FWB types of arrangements, and told her that we could be friends if she wanted to. She asked if i knew whether i'd be ready for a relationship sometime soon, and i said that i didn't know and i can't promise her anything. Alright, she agreed we would just be friends if that's cool with me, which it was. We texted a bit in the next couple of days, i noticed she was a bit flirty with me but didn't pay much attention to it. So this morning, she calls me and says she's in front of my apartment and i invited her up to have a coffee. Cool, we drank coffee, we talked, but then at one point she started getting handsy and started kissing me on the cheek, trying to kiss my neck, so i knew what was going on and told her to please stop. She didn't stop. Instead she put her hand on my junk, i removed her hand, she put it there again and started talking about all sorts of things she wanted me to do to her...sounds like a dream now that i'm typing it out, but it was very real an hour ago. I kept rejecting her, and she was constantly talking how she can see that i want it, there's no shame in it, that type of stuff.

We\u2019ll have sex and then afterwards he will say things like \u201cyeah I owe it to you\u201d or something after I say it was good or whatever. \n\nThis morning, I tried explaining to him that I just want him to want me and not want me because he feels like he\u2019s obligated to.

Sex was not involved that night just for the record. Naturally I was ecstatic. I thought we were finally heading toward the same page, but I never asked for clarity because I was so lost in that high. \n\nOver the next month and half we had such a wonderful time, part of which included sending each other more frequent nudes over Snapchat. One night I got a little daring and actually put my face in one. He ended up taking a screenshot of it. He said he really liked it and asked if it was okay that I did that, to which I said yes. I remember being a little anxious at the time, but I pushed it down. \n\nAfter about a month and a half, after a couple sour nights of drinking, things kinda took a poor turn, but not exactly the end of all things. About two weeks later, I finally got the courage to ask, hey\u2014what are we? To which I really got no clear answer from him. I always knew he wasn\u2019t my \u201cboyfriend\u201d (I just use that here to simplify things a bit) because it was never said explicitly, but we acted so much like it, the title just as well might have been. \n\nAnyway, he said he loved me as more than just a friend\u2014and that was about as close to anything I got beyond the reality that he doesn\u2019t consider us to actually be anything \u201clabel\u201d-wise. I\u2019ve asked him to think more about what he wants from me, because I want something commitment like with him, and the limbo of spending four nights a week at his house and emotionally investing myself into him more than I already was is beginning to weigh me down.\n\nLast night, I asked him for two things. One was some more of the money he owed me for helping him get his car fixed three months ago (he\u2019s not well off with money, but he\u2019s made no initiative himself to pay me back other than the one time I asked him about a month ago), and the second was that he delete or remove my face from that nude screenshot. I explained that I had been okay with him having it originally because I thought he and I were actually something. The more I learned that that wasn\u2019t the case for him (either not in this moment or ever) I was no longer comfortable that that picture existed. \n\nAfter that second request, he got a little curt and immediately went to bed, refusing to answer any of my texts save for one. I made a comment that it kinda hurt that he couldn\u2019t even say good night or love you like he\u2019d been doing, to which he just insulted me by saying everything seems to kinda hurt me, which actually really did hurt me to realize he cares so little about my feelings. \n\nSo, my main question here\u2014was I wrong to ask for those things last night\u2014specifically that he delete the picture? How do I fix this situation. \n\nTl;dr: Turns out my BF isn\u2019t my BF. I asked him to delete a nude photo of me with my face in it\u2014he now seems to want nothing to do with me.

We have 3 kids and a bad financial situation. Divorce is not an easy option and we both want to try to salvage the marriage but I don't know if I can.\n\n  \nLet me start with some backstory. We\u2018ve been together for almost 17 years, have 3 kids an old house we\u2018ve been slowly restoring over the last 2 years and our budget is not the greatest, no savings and lots of debt.\n\nShe\u2018s the only woman I\u2018ve ever been with and before me, she had only a couple of one-night stands, so we were both little experienced when we met. She\u2018s been the light of my life and we\u2018ve gone through some difficult times together and always have we been there for another. I thought we were one of the few who managed to stay on course no matter what. Apparently I was wrong.\n\nWith all that was going on, trying to fix the house, both working full time, trying to make ends meet and to make sure the kids are doing fine, we kinda lost ourselves. The bad financial situation and health related issues didn\u2018t help either. My wife had been trying to lose weight for a long time but nothing seemed to work for her and her self esteem was down to the floor. We were both depressed, but instead of talking and consoling one another, we suffered in silence. I buried my nose in computer games to hide from our problems while she had her nose in her phone all the time. This spring and summer, things started going worse. She was spending more time with her friends and going partying, while I stayed at home with the kids. I thought that if I let her \u201eblow off some steam\u201c that she would come home in a better mood, but that didn\u2018t work at all.\n\nI tried to ignore the bad feeling that was starting to sink in my stomach. I had heard a rumor that she had been seen kissing some dude at a dance in a nearby town. I confronted her about it, but she denied and said that the guy had tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away. I was not fully convinced, but didn\u2018t want to push her too much as I was trying to let her see that I trusted her. Yet as the summer passed, I noticed she was getting way more protective and secretive about her phone. After seing by chance what her FB password was one night in august 22nd, I decided to taka a look, to see if I could find anything about that dance earlier that summer. What I found was way worse.\n\nI saw that indeed she had been kissing some dude drunk as hell until her friend pulled her out of it, but that\u2018s nothing compared to what I saw next. I accessed her Messenger and Skype.\n\nI found out that she had been chatting online with two foreign guys, A and B, for months. It had started on Instagram, some random dude, A, sent her some flattering messages and she started talking to him on Skype after that in early June. After only speaking to him for less than two weeks she started sharing with him nude photos after only resisting a bit. The incident with the guy she kissed happened later that month. She was chatting with this guy A up until midst of August, when he showed his real intention, he was a scammer with a stolen account and was just sending her pictures from that stolen profile. Yet she had been fooled enough to share with him pictures of her most intimate parts. She seemed like she was falling in love with him. By then she was already started to talk to guy B, which also started on Instagram. Didn\u2018t take long for that to evolve to nude pictures and sexual talk. In both cases they were fantasizing about them coming to our country and meet with my wife at a hotel. She never spoke ill of me or anything like that, just talked about me like I was just there. If they asked, she said that I treated her well, but then she went on to tell them how she like to talk to them and they made her feel good. The worst is yet to come.\n\nIn one of the chats with a female friend of hers I found some more disturbing things. They went together to a 2 day town festival in another nearby town in early july, stayed at a rented room, which I of course had agreed to and thought would be ok, and I knew that my wife\u2018s friend who has trouble with panic attacks had needed to stay overnight at the local hospital. But what I didn\u2018t know and saw in that chat between them was that she mentioned a 41 year old guy from our own town (guy C), a married man with kids, who was unhappy in his relationship and she had met him that night. He had come over to chat and had tried to \u201ego all the way\u201c but my wife told her friend that she had stopped him. She didn\u2018t mention the name, but I found out a likely suspect as our town is small and I also found in my online phone records that she had sent a message to a number belonging to a guy that fit the description. I feared the worst.\n\nI didn\u2018t let my wife know what I had found yet, as I was afraid what would happen while the kids were around, so I put up a mask and waited until saturday 24th of august to confront my wife. I had called my mother and got her to take care of the kids. My wife is taking some classes to get some form of degree for her work and when she came home from class I asked her calmly to sit with me and I told her about what I knew. There was no violence, yelling or bad mouthing. Just two sad people, one of them angry and hurt, and we talked the whole night. She promised that nothing had happened between her and \u201eC\u201c and what she had done online was only to try boosting her self esteem a bit as she thought I had stopped loving her. She didn\u2018t exactly try to blame me for it, nor did she yell at me for snooping around. She said she thought I didn\u2018t like her anymore because she wasn\u2018t losing weight and when those guys started raining compliments on her she said she got addicted. She said she didn\u2018t mean to hurt me, she was selfish and tried to please them as she could so they would keep complimenting her, therefore sending them nude pictures. She told me that she saw it now that she had been cheating on me but she hadn\u2018t realised it while she was doing it, even though she knew she was doing something wrong.\n\nI wanted to believe her, I truly did. But I had concerns. We decided to try to fix our marriage and seek counseling. As the weeks passed, things seemed to be getting better. She\u2018s been way more affectionate to me and caring. Our sex life has been great and we\u2018ve been spending way more time together than before. I still had a growing feeling in my stomach that she was hiding some critical information from me and after our second meeting with the marriage counselor last week, she finally admitted the truth. She admitted what I had suspected and feared but deeply hoped hadn\u2018t happened. She had indeed slept with C that night in july. And even though she said she had felt bad afterwards and shameful, she still kept talking to him via social media. She admitted to have met with him twice after that, but nothing more than a bit of kissing. She even tried to contact him again a few days after I had confronted her in august.\n\nMy first response after that was simply freezing. I didn\u2018t yell or curse or anything. I din\u2018t harm her in anyway. I partly felt relieved that she had finally admitted what I suspected, but at the same time I felt humiliated and hurt beyond anything I\u2018ve ever felt before. I didn\u2018t want to rush to anything so I haven\u2018t thrown the ring in her face yet, nor have I confronted the other guy, as I don\u2018t want to be the person to rat on him to his wife or make myself get arrested for assault. Besides, it wasn\u2018t him that broke my marriage contract, it was my wife.\n\nI don\u2018t know what to believe anymore. The woman I thought I knew would never do something like this. She\u2018s been trying to convince me that she was an idiot and selfish and whatnot and that she feels really bad about hurting me like that. She says she\u2018s ready to do anything to fix the situation and to get me to trust her again and feel like she\u2018s worthy again. \n\nHonestly I don\u2018t know if I\u2018ll ever trust her again or see her with the same eyes. I do love her of course and I like to be around her, and see her smile. But at the same time it stings my heart. I want this to work because of the kids and our shitty financial situation, as we can\u2018t afford going through divorce, but I fear that I will lose myself and never gain any self respect if I go through with this.\n\nHow the hell can I forgive her for cheating on me with not only one guy but three? Well, four, if you count that one time she kissed a random guy. She was both emotionally as well as physically cheating with all of them for some period of time. Not just a one drunk night mistake, but some kind of emotional and sexual relationship with three guys for over 2 months. Doesn\u2018t matter if two of those relationships were online. She still planned to meet with them, knowing fully what would happen if they did.\n\nHas anyone here gone through anything similar to this and has some good advice? I know it\u2018s easy to say: \u201ejust divorce her man and move on\u201c, but it\u2018s not that simple. I still have feelings for her and I don\u2018t know what will happen with our kids and our families. I also fear that if I dicorce her, which will mean that her family and friends will know the truth, that she will harm herself or at least be in a mental state where she will have bad influence on our kids.

She was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.\n\nThis didn't really bother me at first - I actually found it kind of hot? Mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - I felt, I guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then I think).\n\nOther than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. Every day is punctuated by \"Insta time\" where I'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for Instagram content... It's ridiculous. We've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, I'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. I'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.\n\nIt was routine stuff, I asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.\n\nSo the thing is, it's absolutely not her career.

Title says it all. I\u2019m a geneticist, and my fianc\u00e9 was recently interested in what his blood type was. His parents are avid donors so I told him to ask what theirs was and I could give him an idea of what his would be. They both sent pictures of their donor cards with their blood types on it. I did a punnet square and give him 2 outcomes. Wanting to know for sure, he had the doctor type him at his most recent appointment. The blood type the doctor gave him is impossible based on his parents. To double check, I made a date day of giving and we went to give blood together and while we were they I asked them to type us and give us cards, same blood type as the doctor gave him.\n\n\nBeing a geneticist, I have always been an advocate of doing 23andMe for the health reports. Three years ago when we got together, I did mine For a class, and being that we\u2019ve talked about kids more recently, I told my fianc\u00e9 he should do one too. He is cool with it and excited to see the reports. His mom has always talked about how she isn\u2019t sure of her ancestry so I mentioned we got him one and asked if she wanted to order as well and she was very against it because she didn\u2019t \u201cwant the government to have her data\u201d. Now I\u2019m not sure if she is aware of something and doesn\u2019t want anyone finding out, or if she truly feels that way. She didn\u2019t seem to know that blood types are able to be figured out by genetics. The whole 23andMe thing happened slightly before the blood typing, and his sample has been submitted so we\u2019re waiting on the results.\n\n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9 asked why he didn\u2019t have the types I told him he would have, I simply told him that I messed up and crossed them the wrong way (he doesn\u2019t know how to do the squares so he shrugged it off and went about his day)\n\n\nNow I\u2019m in quite a pickle with what to do. I\u2019ve stumbled upon business that clearly isn\u2019t mine to know. However, if I ever found out that my fianc\u00e9 knew something like this and didn\u2019t tell me I would feel so betrayed. He submitted his 23andMe sample already and now I\u2019m at a crossroad of what to do because while it\u2019s unlikely, it\u2019s possible that relatives may come back on his report and they won\u2019t be people he knows.\n\n\nAt this point I feel I only have a couple options and none of them sound great.\n\n-talk to his mom first since she would know most about it, and let her talk to him\n\n-talk to him first and let him approach his parents about it\n\n-don\u2019t tell him at all and risk a relative of his that he doesn\u2019t know showing up on 23andMe, and also letting him continue to falsely assume he knows his (genetic) family medical history as we venture down the path of children and growing old\n\n\nAny insight would be appreciated. My last resort is not telling him. It\u2019s making me sick to hide this from him, and I know if this were reversed and I were to find out, I would feel like everyone im closest to is suddenly hard to trust.\n\n\nEDIT: wanted to add that I have known his family for 10 years and we are extremely close. My relationship with his family is as important to me as my relationship with him, and I am afraid if I harm my relationship with his family, it will affect us, and vise versa.\n\n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9s blood type isn\u2019t possible based on his parents blood types. I\u2019m the only one who knows this based on genetics. 23andMe sample was submitted before this info was stumbled upon, and were waiting on results of 23andMe.

University educated. Healthy, fit. I have a career, I'm financially secure and fine. I support my younger siblings financially. I have 5 younger siblings all in their late teens to mid twenties. I live with all of them, its the culture I grew up in. You don't move out until you're married. I'm single, never married. I've never been in a serious relationship before. I'm definitely religious, but not a virgin.\nThis all began when I began working for the government with in a department I won't mention due to privacy. I was there for a year, worked 40 hours a week, kept my head down, etc. Then around Jan 2019 my boss was leaving to another department. I applied for the position but didn't get the job. Instead, they hired a new girl from the private sector.\n\nWe were around the same age. She's only 2 years older than me. But we couldn't be any different. She's white, tattooed, atheist. I'm Somali (black), Muslim, I introduced myself and she smiled at me. I tried to speak but I stuttered (I grew up with a stuttering problem but I outgrew it, however it comes back from time to time). I hurried back in my desk in embarrassment.\nThe first few months were normal.It was a huge learning curve for her. A lot of people questioned the hire but she quickly proved people wrong. She was smart, quick thinker, witty, no filter (once you get to know her).\n\nThat winter, I came out of the office one Friday afternoon and saw her car wasn't starting. It was super cold, and I gave her a boost. She was incredibly thankful and hugged me. I didn't think of it at all and went about my business.\nEvery month I have our monthly 1 on 1 meetings to discuss my performance. At first it was business as usual. But as the months wore on these meetings became more and more just as talking and catching up. She would ask me questions and we would chat about virtually anything. I also knew for a fact that she didn't do this for others. She was extremely professional with them. Again, my naive self didn't connect the dots. I know, stupid.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, my mother is a commanding presence. I'm a 27 year old grown man and she lets me be usually, but still annoys me. If its after midnight she still calls asking where I am. Its super annoying but I love her to death. She's also been pushing me to get married. She keeps telling me that she knows many young girls back in Somalia that would be interested. I laugh it off but I knew she was serious.\n\nAnyway, my boss at work would message me on the MSN chat that we have set up at work. It was just a casual conversation. One day when I was talking to her (I stutter and sometimes talk fast), I mentioned my brother, she misheard and thought I said my \"brother in law\". Her entire expression changed, as if it bothered her if I was married. When I clarified that she gave me a beamed smile. Hr smile was very attractive to me.\nThen she added me on facebook. We chatted some more. Just friendly things. I considered telling a coworker who I trust, but I figured I couldn't do it. Too much gossip and just wasn't worth it.\n\nThen came a celebration this past summer. A coworker invited all of us to Boston Pizza and many people from work came. I never drank a sip of alcohol in my life up until that point. I felt a little hazed but since I had half a cup I was still pefectly ok. I realized it was only me and her walking out together. There was a cab right in front of the place and I got in. I thought she was walking me to my cab but she went in the cab too. She gave the driver the address. I was shocked. Stunned. Mystified. When she touched my leg and started messaging my thigh I had a huge boner and couldn't control myself.\nWe went back to her apartment and had sex. Incredible sex. And yes, I used protection. She was so attractive it was mind boggling. She said she would get a tattoo with my name on it on her ass cheek. That turned me on more. She taught me different positions I didn't think of before.\nI spent the night with her. The I panicked. I looked at my phone. It was 430am and I had 34 missed calls from my mother. I called her back telling her I was with my friend and would be staying at his for the night. I texted my friend and he covered for me. I know its pathetic at age 27 but what can you do.\n\nThe next morning I left and she kissed me goodbye. I left with regret because I went against my religion.\n\nBut it didn't end there.\n\nThe next working day she walked by my desk and handed me a small piece of paper. It had her number on it. I texted her and we swapped all of sorts of stuff to each other.\nLong story short, I spent a lot of time at her apartment for the next 3-4 months. At first, the thrill and excitement was amazing. But then I began to really like her. But I was torn. I love my family too. But there was no way in a million years my mother would ever accept a her. Especially given that she's atheist.\nThen the nightmare really began: I got a text from her saying she wanted to discuss something. I honestly thought it was because she wanted to end things. Which hurt me, but I thought it was for the best. When we did meet, she started with \"I didn't have my period this month\". It still didn't click for me. Then the following two words gave me a heart attack almost.\n\n\"I'm pregnant\".\n\nMy world shattered that instant. I thought to myself, \"how\". I've used protection every time I've been with her. But that didn't matter.\nThen it hit me what I've been doing. I've been sleeping with my boss for 4 months now, putting both of our careers in jeopardy, and I've gotten her pregnant. To a girl my mother would NEVER EVER accept. Not only that, but this is not how I wanted to have a child.\nBut at the same time, I do like her. She's incredibly smart, attractive, fit, and really caring. However, with that being said, she can have some violent outbursts at times. She's not a morning person and can get extremely moody. But nobody is perfect.\n\nShe told me she is having the child whether I'm going to be involved or not. She told me she has feelings for me and is willing to try a relationship but not at this point in our careers at work. Abortion is out of the question anyway, its against my values and beliefs.\n\nShe told me I should tell my mother, but I don't have the stomach for it. I love my mother to death. I'd take a bullet for her anytime. But this would break her heart. She is incredibly religious and I know her. SHE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THIS. I don't want to burden her more, she has already been through a lot.\n\nI like my girlfriend I guess you can call it, but I don't love her. I care about her future and her well being, but I'm conflicted if she's the person I want something long term with.\n\nWhat should I do? I'm ready to be a father, but not like this? My family will disown me. They wouldn't want to meet her. My community will shun me.\n\nI've never been depressed like this before.

We've known each other for another three years before that, so 9 years total. We're getting married in February. Or we were, I don't know any more. We're visiting my parents to meet some more of my extended family, so they get to know him before the wedding. My parents offered to host us, and we've been staying in my old room. I'm \\[F29\\], he's \\[M32\\].\n\nWe are staying with my parents. My fiance wanted to stay at a hotel, but I thought it will be fun to sleep in my old room. And to be here with my mom and dad one last time under their roof before I become a married woman.\n\nMy parents have been in a non conventional marriage for a long time. It was a shock for me to learn about it, and I learnt to cope with it. I am not necessarily comfortable with their life styles, but I can't do anything about it. They basically go on dates with other people, spend time with other people, sleep with other people. Had to learn it when I came home a few days earlier from a trip with a friend's family, and my father was sleeping next to another woman, when I was 16. I freaked out then, and my parents had to explain to me it was all fine.\n\nSo my fiance could not sleep last night, and went outside for some fresh air because he is not used to sleep away from our bed back home. And he found my mom kissing another guy in my parent's foyer.\n\nSo he freaked out, started yelling at her, came and woke me up, demanded I call my father and tell him he found my mom cheating on him.\n\nSo my mom had to explain to my fiance about my parent's non conventional marriage, but it didn't go well with him. And once it seemed like he is calming down and starts to accept what my mom was telling him, he figured out I knew about their marriage, and he started freaking out on me.\n\nHe told me that he can't trust me any more, that he was set up, that I insisted we stay with our parents so that I can ease him in the idea, so I can enforce my parents principles on our own marriage, and I simply can't get through to him.\n\nMy fiance has been cheated on before, his parents have divorced because his mom cheated on his dad, and he doesn't have a good relationship with her, he could barely stomach the idea of having her come to our wedding.\n\nHe went to a hotel for tonight, and said he will be leaving back home tomorrow. he's not really answering his phone or texting back.\n\nhe says he needs to reevaluate our engagement, that he doesn't think he can marry me knowing I approve my parents marriage style. That I wanted to manipulate him and introduce this life style in our relationship.\n\nThe truth is I am ashamed of my parents and their relationships, and I had no idea they will behave like this while my fiance is around, let alone sleeping in their house. he simply doesn't believe me because I haven't talked about it since I've met him. It's not something I find easy to talk about, and the less I think about it the better.\n\nHow can I talk with him? I have no interest in my parents style of relationship, I am fully dedicated to my fiance, and I have never been interested in another person since I've met him.\n\nI don't want to lose him over this stupid thing, and I feel ashamed he had to find out about my parents like this.

Somehow on the last day of this vacation my sister came up with this idea that I molested her. This was completely random, no context it just happened. My dad came to me in a flurry of anger and very aggressively threw against the floor and wall without saying anything. Once I was able to sit and respond with probably like wtf he told me what she said. I was stunned and confused and explained that I never had done anything to her. He then told me my best friend (who lives 1000 miles away and had never met my family) told my sister I did it because I confided in my friend. This was the first major red flag for me that this wasn\u2019t a joke or some shit but they were being serious. \n\nNow for some context. I am the oldest of 9. When I was 5 I myself was \u201csexually abused\u201d by my ex-stepsister (moms ex husbands daughter? She was maybe 12 at this time) but I am the oldest. I didn\u2019t know any better and it never bothered me a ton later on. We were kids. Saying that I was still the oldest and when I got to that 10-12 range I definitely got curious about human anatomy and I will say it here. I was a peeping Tom on my 6 year old sister. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. What I was looking at. Or what to do with it. And I never touched her. I was nothing more that a curious 10 year old child who was the oldest in his family. It took me a long time to be willing to accept that. \n\nThis happened the second to last day of vacation. I slept alone and flew home the next day, they drove. I lived alone and hardly saw them due to distance but tried to go twice a month. I stopped contacting them and they all blocked my phone number, fb, etc. except my dad who continued to text call and harass me. My sister went to the police when we got home where the story changed to she found it in my phone which could have been possible as she had my old phone. I had to deal with state and dcf, and then the local police from the town we grew up where this would have happened. I met with an officer after playing phone tag for nearly 2 months with him and dcf leaving eachother voicemails a few times a week. When I met with him we talked over what happened on vacation, the accusations, and what happened to me as a child. That was the end of it from the police. My dad continued to text me so I blocked him finally. About 6 months go by and he calls my work phone which was emergencies only. I had forgotten he had that number. He basically said that the DA was filing paperwork to have me arrested, the fbi would be taking me and some other over the top stuff. It all seemed way too much but I called that officer I spoke with to check in and he had nothing new for me he said to call the da office so I did and there were no cases in my name or my fathers(he would have to represent my sister). After this we went quiet for 6 months until my aunt(mother\u2019s side) called me cause she ran into my dad at Home Depot and he told her all these terrible things I did. She asked me and I explained everything and she was all good and no longer concerned about me with any of it. Then a few of my friends found out when he told them. Then some people I work with. After about a year I quit my job to get away from it all, changed phone numbers and moved across the country. Right when I moved I found out my sister just had a baby, at 16. 6 months later my dad emailed me asking to go see my grandfather on his deathbed and my sisters baby \u201clet her show you the baby, let her tell you about the baby she really wants to\u201d we\u2019re his exact words. I said I moved across country and couldn\u2019t and never responded again. \n\nNow it\u2019s been about a year and he has been emailing an old email I use for spam for a few months begging me to text him or call him as he can\u2019t live like this anymore and needs me back. I\u2019m honestly torn on if I should reply to see what he has to say or just keep moving forward with my new life. So... any advice? \n\nSorry if this sounds like a random jumble of words I don\u2019t have time to proof read atm and will answer as much as I can\u2019t after work.

She sent me a link and to some of those male enlargement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. I thought she was just joking so I \"LOL'd,\" said no, and brushed it off. When I saw her yesterday (Monday), she said \"I have something for you.\" To my surprise, she pulled out a bottle of those pills.\n\nI said, \"What the F\\*\\*\\*, are you serious right now? Really?\" She said, \"Relax I'm not saying you are not big enough. I just want to choke on an extra inch or three of you. I thought you would be cool with it.\" I said, \"First of all, that is not for you to decide. Secondly, why would I do that for you? I'm comfortable with my endowment. Lastly, IF I were to consider this as a possiblity, you do know all of that is false adverting right? That stuff does not work.\" She said, \"There is only one way to find out. Here, take them.\" I told her to leave and have not uttered a word to her. My phone is still blowing up with texts and calls. From the texts and voicemails, I can tell she did not expect me to tell her to leave. I kept cool as all of this was happening because I thought she was still kidding... \n\nIt irritates me that she did this. I wouldn't say she isn't happy with my size, but clearly her actions are alluding to this without her having to even say it. My question is, dear Redditors, am I overthinking/overreacting? I am considering ending it. She has apologized but I fear the damage is done. What she did was uncalled for and should only be done if one is insecure about their size. I still love her, but this stings still! Should I break it off? What should I say? Is there a way to recover from this? \n\nP.S. I did tell her, \"OK, I will take the pills, but only if you get a boob job.\" She said \"Yes because I love you.\" \ud83d\ude02", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2136622, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My GF (28F) Joked About Male Enlargement Pills, I (28M) Brushed it Off....

My father was very abusive and beat my brother and me for the dumbest things (not finishing dinner or not cleaning our room) but he left us for what I\u2019m now sure was a prostitute. I grew up in the suburbs of a somewhat large city with just one older brother (I had a half sister I met a few times, also a drug addict like my mom, died from overdose). For most of my childhood my brother took care of me and made sure I was safe while our mom was out getting high. However, when I was 8 years old and he was 15 it was like he became a completely different person. My brother started to get into trouble at school; in one case he brutally beat a boy two years his senior almost to death. He got into a lot of trouble with the cops, but my mother was not there to guide him down the right path. He started down an ugly path of destruction (arson, robbery, and joined a gang). \n\n\nNSFW WARNING\n\nI remember the first night he violated me and probably always will despite years of therapy. We shared a bedroom in a shitty apartment (mom was on welfare, we were poor) and he came in on a school night probably around 11-12 at night. I woke up when he was trying to sneak in, but he wasn\u2019t very inconspicuous and I am a light sleeper. He stood probably a foot away from my bed and I could smell alcohol on him. It was weird because he spoke to me very softly and what seemed gentle and not hurtful when he said we were going to play a game and I had to wear his bandanna as a blindfold. I thought we were going to play hide and seek (I was 8, didn\u2019t know any better) but he covered my mouth with his hand, lifted up my nightgown, tore off my underwear, and molested me for what felt like an eternity. I had no idea what was happening at first and didn\u2019t even understand when it was all happening but I cried and whimpered and my body was so tense. He molested me with his hands and a metallic, cold object. I think I eventually passed out from the pain and not being able to breathe (he covered my mouth the whole time). When I got up for school the next morning he was already gone, my mother was gone too, and I was home alone supposed to get myself ready for school (not unusual for me). There was blood in my sheets and I was very confused. I went to school as normal but sometime in the afternoon there was blood in my pants. I went to the school nurse who assumed I was having my period, gave me pads, and sent me on my way. A couple months went by before he attacked me again, this time I didn\u2019t smell alcohol, he just seemed so angry and was being very aggressive. He did not blindfold me or cover my mouth this time, instead he penetrated my anus as I cried loudly and begged him to stop but mom wasn\u2019t home and nobody was going to save me. I tried to fight back by scratching at his face and trying so hard to get out from under him but he was already 6 feet tall at 15 years old and I wasn\u2019t strong enough. The next and last time he attacked me he was 16 and I was 9. I think I got somewhat of amnesia during the time that passed because I didn\u2019t remember what happened until he raped me for the last time and it all came back. My mother came home with some random druggie guys and they were probably all getting high in the living room when I was getting ready to go to bed. My brother was not home and who the hell knows what he was doing, I don\u2019t even want to know. When he got home my mom was already passed out I guess, but her boyfriends were still there. This time was the worst and the scariest. He got ready for bed (he usually just came in and crashed or spent the whole night out) so it was weird to me he was taking a bath and brushing his teeth or whatever. He came into our room and I was just starting to fall asleep. He climbed into my bed and I laid as still as possible pretending to be asleep. He whispered in the dark to me in the most terrifying and dead voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. He grabbed my throat, mounted me, and penetrated my vagina. It was so sudden and so vicious and awfully painful. I screamed this time, for the first time I was able to find my voice, and one of my moms boyfriends came bursting in yelling and beat the shit out of my brother. My brother was arrested and I tried to forget everything for the next 12 years. He was put in juvey, had to attend therapy, and diagnosed with antisocial disorder. I was amazed how much my mother reacted and how she changed completely, she attended rehab (first time left, but second time stayed and got so much better). We moved into a new apartment and stayed there until I was 17. I graduated high school and moved to a new city to go to community college and work full time. My mom passed away from a long battle with HIV/AIDS when I just turned 18. My brother ended up in prison for a few years doing time for robbery. I struggled with my moms loss especially since we were closer now and she became the mom I really needed. My brother got out of prison a week ago and since has tried to make contact with me. I live on my own and was terrified when I got a missed call from him asking if he could borrow money. His \u201capology\u201d sounded very sincere on the phone but he was always a charming kind of person and I have no intention to see him or help him. I contacted the police but there\u2019s nothing they can do for now and changed my number. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to forgive my brother and he\u2019s probably just trying to use me. I\u2019ve been staying with my friend to be safe. I don\u2019t know what to do. So much shit has happened in my life it\u2019s really affecting me and I feel like I\u2019m going to have a full blown break down. \n\nTLDR: brother sexually assaulted me in childhood, he went to juvey and prison, got out, and is now trying to make contact with me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2136561, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Brother (28M) who sexually assaulted me (21F) as a child is trying to contact me", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572192697, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljm8e/brother_28m_who_sexually_assaulted_me_21f_as_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SchoolMum", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4t8rmdrl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571755183, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dliuel/19my_mum47_brought_home_a_guy19_from_the_local/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dliuel", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 86, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dliuel/19my_mum47_brought_home_a_guy19_from_the_local/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571755184, "score": 131, "selftext": "I posted this in another sub and I got some feed back but id like some more, the more help the better I say so I thought id see what people think here as well. You can read the other post on my profile but ill post the story here as well as an update on what happened last weekend. Im looking for some advice on what I should do about the situation because of my history with the guy. I cant exactly talk about this with my friends or it would become a running joke with me.\n\nFor a bit of back story, last year unfortunately my parents broke up which was something that was going to happen eventually, lots of fighting and arguments. Since then my mum has been reliving her early years lets say, shes been going out about once or rarely twice a month for a while with her friends to clubs and pubs in town for a few months now, she was honest with me when I asked why and said shes trying to find a new partner/husband which I totally understand and supportive of.\n\nJust over two weeks ago she had her monthly night out with her friends and came back with a guy in the early hours of the morning, this isnt the first time this has happened as she had brought back two guys before. Now my sleeping pattern is a bit messed up so I was still awake when she came back in the early hours of the morning and I heard the door so I went down to check to see if she was alright.\n\nAs I went downstairs you can see into the living room from them so I looked and saw her with someone, I hide out of sight and looked again as I didnt want to be seen, they were both on the sofa making out and the guy stood up and I knew him from school, I went back to my room before I saw anything I didnt want to see but it wasnt long before they came up stairs and went into my mothers room, I think you understand what happened next...\n\nSince I made my other post last week theres been another development. My mum went out last weekend again with him for the 3rd time in the space of a month (she went out a 2nd time with him on the weekend before and he came home with her again), shes never gone out three times in such a short space of time for a night out which makes me think this isnt a one night stand with him anymore, biggest difference this time was my mother didnt come home so she must of slept over at his for the night, she went out at about 6pm and didnt come home till 10am the next day.\n\nSo for the background on the guy and why I kinda have a problem with the whole thing is he wasnt exactly the nicest guy in school, he use to bully one of my close friends all the time and making his life unpleasant so we had some disagreements and arguments in school over it, mainly me sticking up for my friend. This is the reason why Im not exactly happy about the whole thing as I think my mother can do better than someone like that. \n\nI dont have a problem with her sleeping with guys and people around my age if thats what she wants, she is an adult after all and its her house but I dont want her to do it with people I know to be honest. So Im kinda 50/50 on what to do about the whole thing, neither of them know that I know about there thing they have going on. Some people have said to say something to her about it but others have said to just leave them alone as it wont last long and let my mum have some enjoyment. \n\nSo id appreciate some help and advice on what the hell I should do about the whole thing, should I say something or leave them alone?\n\nTLDR: My mother went out just over two weeks ago for a night out, came home with a guy I had problems with in school and shes now slept with him three times after bring him home twice and sleeping over at his place on the 3rd time last weekend.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2136443, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[19]My Mum[47] brought home a guy[19] from the local club two weeks ago that I went to school with, shes now slept with him three times.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572192015, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dliuel/19my_mum47_brought_home_a_guy19_from_the_local/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DevOcean_88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ug5h8n9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571750490, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlhuug/he_pretended_the_proposal_was_a_joke_incase_i_was/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlhuug", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 93, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlhuug/he_pretended_the_proposal_was_a_joke_incase_i_was/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571750491, "score": 231, "selftext": "So 2 years ago my SO(27M) at the time Proposed to me(30F)\nIt was my Birthday, we were sitting on our bed just chatting and he pulls out a ring and asks.\nI said Yes, followed by lots of excitment/shock and said something along the lines of \"omg really?\" In a happy way not a condescending way if that makes sense.\n\nHe then turns around and says the entire proposal was a joke.\nHe starts saying things like \"do you really think I'd propose to you with a crappy ring like that?\" And \"If this was a real proposal I would've put in more effort, not just done it at home\" etc etc etc.\n\nCue me getting absolutely furious and heartbroken all at once.

It\u2019s still regularly, like a couple of times a week as opposed to a couple of times a day. We\u2019re both busier now with work and college and more tired, so I don\u2019t always want to do it. I also get sore so can\u2019t do it multiple times in a row. He\u2019s been shaming me a lot recently like if I talk about sex in any way, he\u2019ll say \u201cyou don\u2019t have a sex drive anyway\u201d or \u201cyou never want to have sex.\u201d This is frustrating because he\u2019s acting as though I never want sex anymore even though he do is several times a week. \n\nThe other day we went to a hotel for the night. We had sex once and then we was trying to get me to do it again but I didn\u2019t want to. He got annoyed and I got annoyed back at him because I felt so pressured. I told him to stop going into these moods because of sex. He then watched a movie in silence without speaking once and when I tried gently talking to him and telling him I didn\u2019t want to argue, he snapped. He pinned me down and called me a psycho cunt, a piece of shit and said he hated me. I went into full blown panic mode because I didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on. He kept threatening to leave the hotel and I was scared because he\u2019s the one who drives and I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d get home. \n\nEventually it turned out he was so angry because of three reasons 1) we don\u2019t have sex as many times as we used to 2) I go home to see my family for the weekend every couple of weeks and leave him alone and 3) I\u2019ve been busy and stressed lately due to all my college deadlines coming at once. I apologized for how I\u2019ve been lately but I went to sleep in a bit of a mess after crying so much. Early in the morning I woke up to him cuddling me and trying to take my pants down. I tried pulling away but he kept doing it. It took about a minute of struggling and trying to get away before he stopped and he got angry and said \u201cyou never want to.\u201d \n\nThen we had a shower together and he told me to turn around. I said no, I didn\u2019t want to, as I was still really upset but he was still trying to turn me around. I could have stopped him but I was afraid he\u2019d be annoyed again so I just went along with him and let him do it, and I didn\u2019t even react and waited for it to be over. Since we\u2019ve gotten home, he\u2019s been really sweet and nice to me. I feel like incidents like the one in the hotel happens and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s really him and it\u2019s so shocking that when he goes back to normal I just tell myself that the normal him is the real him and the anger was out of character. I\u2019m afraid now to go home any weekend in case he blows up.

However, I have 2 lectures at university where attendance is mandatory (note: in our country you can miss 2 appointments. However, if you miss more than 2, you will not pass the course).

I'm about to vent and this is going to be incredibly long. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think I ever loved him as much as he loved me. We got together when I was 16 and he was 17 -- he'd been in relationships before, but he was my first everything. He didn't make me laugh but he made up for that in all the ways that count. There were many moments throughout the years when I thought that I should end it, but I didn't know how and the few times I tried, he begged me to stay and make it work. It may have been wrong to let it go on for this long but I loved him so much, and I still do.  I've just never been *in* love with him. I'm not really sure what that feels like but I don't think I've felt it.\n\nThroughout our relationship I believed he was the gentlest, kindest, most honest person I've ever met. Lately though, he's been growing more and more distant. Not in an obvious way. He still cares for me: he asks me about my day, he calls me 'his love' and a generous selection of other pet names, he kisses me, he shows the utmost concern for my well-being when I'm at a low point in my mental health (which, I admit, isn't rare and I can see it taking its toll on him). I do the same for him. But I've been noticed the subtle early release when we embrace, the lack of sexual interest, the disinterest in even just snuggling on the couch together. He tries to hide it but I can see right through him.\n\nFor the past few months, he has been complaining nonstop about work and constantly telling me that he needs to work late. He's a chef and his kitchen is genuinely understaffed so I foolishly took him at his word. For context, his restaurant closes at 3PM and when he first started there, it wasn't unusual for him to stay til 6-7PM to prep for the next day or two. These days, he's been coming home anywhere between 8-midnight. Unless he's \"going out with his coworkers\", in which case he doesn't come home until 2-3AM. He comes home with armed with excuses on nights that he claims to have worked, often with alcohol on his breath -- but don't worry, it's just his boss constantly offering him hard liquor and the poor guy just can't refuse! \n\nSo onto the climax. He came home late again last night and I'd waited to start the laundry so he could throw in his chef jacket. I asked him to pull it out of his backpack and he scurried away to the bedroom with it. He has his back towards me and I watched him try to subtly take a pair of my (!!) comfy fleece pyjama pants out of his bag and onto the floor. I asked him why he had them in his work bag and guys, I've never seen someone lie so swiftly and effortlessly to my face while being 100% certain they were lying. He casually told me that he brought them to work since he's been working such exhausting hours and he wanted to wear them while finishing up the close. We joked about needing to buy new sweatpants (most of ours have holes in them and we've been procrastinating getting new ones) and left it at that. But that nagging feeling that I'd been lied to wouldn't go away so I decided to do something about it.\n\nI went through his email and found a bunch of messages from various men to his Facebook. I tried to login to his Facebook, but he changed the email to his account (it's still active) so I had no way of seeing those messages. I wasn't even aware he had another email address. I assumed the messages were sexual; I'd dealt with this type of cheating before. He had cried and apologized profusely, begged me not to leave him, promised he would never do anything like this again, that as a trans man, he felt like he just needed to feel validated by cis men. We worked through it then but I already knew I would not stick around this time.\n\nFast forward to today, I decided to do some more detective work. I noticed the cuffs of my pyjamas were rolled up -- I never roll them up, and he hasn't worn them lately. I lifted them up and smelled them. They smelled like a woman. Interesting.\n\n I decided to peruse his email some more. I noticed he had a staggering number of Uber receipts -- like, *hundreds.* I was intrigued and started clicking, and my heart was racing so fast as I realized he hadn't been Ubering from work all those nights he told me he was working late. I scrolled through months of our messages and his rides to and from this one specific place coincided with every time he was working past 6-7PM. He was Ubering to this place after work, after drinks with his coworkers, from there to our home. There's one ride I found that hurt me the most. I was experiencing some of my worst PMDD symptoms and seriously not doing well. Despite this, he said he wanted to go see a movie with his coworkers and I encouraged him to do so. He texted me from inside the theater saying the movie was just starting. *The timestamp on the text directly coincided with the time he was sitting in his Uber, on his way to his favourite spot.* He continued to tell me that he might go for drinks with his coworkers after the movie, and I expressed how hurtful it was that he didn't seem to really care that I was in pain. He agreed, apologized, and told me he'd come straight home after the movie and take care of me. I realize now that he was just trying to buy himself time with whoever he was seeing.\n\nHe's grown increasingly secretive with his phone but I managed to look through it tonight. He's been seeing a female coworker he's only mentioned to me in passing. Like, he'll talk to me at length about all his other coworkers but I never hear about her. They've known each other for a few months but I've already been replaced. They refer to each other as friends as she knows he's in a long-term relationship, but they exchange 'I love you's and sweet emojis every day. He talks about how pretty she is, about holding her, kissing her head, loving the way she thinks. He hasn't said those things to me in ages. The pyjamas? They were having a pyjama party with jello shots and ADHD meds that he stole from me.\n\nI'm glad I know how he feels now, but honestly, it would've been better if they just fucked. Those incredibly personal texts were so painful to read. He writes record-breaking paragraphs to her when she's feeling down. He's confided in her about his true feelings towards me. He's even told her about an incredibly vulnerable moment I had recently during sex -- something I would never have expected him to do.\n\nI feel hurt and betrayed, like I have no idea who I've been living with for the past 4 years.

I have a stable job and decent income, which my partner of 3 years has always called attention to. Whenever he wanted me to pay for something,  my partner would often say to me, \"you earn 4x more than I do, you can afford it.\" I have paid over half of our rental fees in every rental we have lived in, even though he could afford it if he wanted to. This has been a touchy issue in our relationship, and looking back, I feel like I have been manipulated into paying more than my fair share. He also often brings up the point of being \"egalitarian\" with expenses, but I would like to save for myself.\n\nIn our last rental, my partner paid $600 while I paid $800 for rent PLUS utilities. For my new mortgage, I will be paying $2500 a month,  which would be affordable to me on my own, but it would almost match my budget - I'd barely have anything to save. My partner, who doesn't know what he wants to do career wise (he says he wants to be a climate change advocate for his dream job, and truly thinks it's okay to pursue a passion job instead of make a decent income) just took a job that pays $1000 a month through Americorps (this is a one year contracted position). It's a supervisor position, which he says will come in handy later in order to apply for  \"dream job,\" whatever that is. He also has a side gig that helps him earn $75 a month. My partner wants to only pay $600 rent, no utilities, while living in my 3 bedroom house.\n\nSo, I got a roommate, which my partner is still deeply opposed to. I needed to save money to pay for home repairs. All I asked my partner to do was to pay $700, a flat rent amount for my house, no utilities, and he freaked out and said I was sucking him dry. He said that his monthly budget would be $950 if I charged him $700 rent - $150 of this budget being misc. expenses. He has $3000-$5000 saved in his bank account. He also dog sits occasionally and receives money from that. I don't understand why he can't even pay me a decent roommate rental fee. \n\nAnother thing is, because I now have an asset, I brought up the possibility of a prenup if we ever got married. My partner also freaked out to this, and said that only non-trusting couples get prenups. \n\nAm I a terrible human being for wanting my partner to pay $700 for rent? He says I'm greedy, but am I?

I was always into computer games and was spending a lot of time playing in that period. I was broken hearted, said I can try to change, we pulled through.\nIn 2014 we had a baby boy, then in 2015 after going back to work (1 year after birth) she started to change for the worse. Lashing out at me, always being snappy and mad for the tiniest things, she was not a good mother to our son either. She grew colder towards me and I to her.\nThis kept going till this year, I started talking to her about splitting up as it's probably best for everybody, me, her, our son. I always suspected she cheated on me, but had no proof of that, it was only a gut feeling.\nToday she admitted that she cheated on me with a coworker in 2015. While at work they went to a bathroom and had sex there. This happened 3 times, several months apart, inside of a year. I know the guy, for what its worth he's not prettier than me or more muscular/taller. She said she ended it as she realised what she was doing was wrong. She says this is the reason for her behavior change and that this was hanging over her head ever since causing her to lash out as it was consuming her. She also said she was afraid this would get out and I would find out and her colleagues would too, leading to her getting fired and me kicking her out of the house.\nI am devastated by this and can only now comprehend what it means to be cheated on and how that makes you feel. I guess first time it happened I wasn't that affected as we just started dating. But now we are married and have a kid together. I never want to do this to another human beeing. It's too cruel.\nThe reason for this post is that I don't underatand how her cheating on me was the excuse for her bad behaviour towards me and our son and I don't know if I should try to forgive her or not. From inside the things appear one way, from outside they may seem different.

During this time she has also been involved in a family business that puts a lot of stress on her. She hates going to work and feels trapped by her family obligations. Also during this time we became empty nesters. As she started feeling physically better, we started going out dancing to various bars in the area with bands. One place in particular really appealed to her and we brought several sets of friends along to experience it, but none of them were really interested in going back very often. \n\nNow, my wife likes dancing more than I do. I enjoy dancing with her, but once or twice a week is sort of enough for me. Long story short, she has been going out some nights without me for a while now, mostly with girlfriends. At one point, this other guy started paying her more attention. She said that she was happy to have a guy friend and we went round and round about whether it was appropriate. At one point, I happened to see a text come through with the little kissy emoji and called her out on it. She told me that she shut him down, and he since got into a relationship with a woman who lives about 3 hours away. He is part of a group of friends/acquiantences that we do things with from time to time. She got into the habit of meeting him for a walk after work on nice afternoons. When our conversations would circle around to him, she always assured me that he knew she was happily married and that she would never do anything other than talk with him.\n\nLast night though, she went out to the Sunday band at this bar down the road. She said that she was meeting a girlfriend (who I know) and that she was planning to be home early because she has a big work week starting today. A bit after 10, she texted that the music was over and they were hanging out chatting.I had been doing laundry, so got the text about 1/2 hr later and said, great drive safe. \"Will do\"\n\nI went to bed and woke up around 1:45. Texted her asking if she was OK. \"Yes, heading home.\"\n\nAt 2:40 I texted Tonight? \"Yes\"\n\nAt 4:00 I called her phone and it went to voice mail. She called back in a few minutes and said that she fell asleep at some woman's house where they went to hang out.\n\nShe got home 20 minutes later, came and gave me a kiss on the forehead (I was awake in bed) I just gave her a sort of gruff hello and she ended up curled up going to sleep on the couch downstairs. I went down and gave her a hug and asked if she understood why I was upset. She said, yes, and I'm so sorry, and I didn't want to keep you up. I told her I hadn't slept since i woke up hours ago anyway and she might as well come to bed. She cuddled up next to me and fell asleep.\n\nIn the morning, she got up before me and basically gave a quick kiss going out the door. I saw that she had done a small load of laundry with just her clothes from the night before. I have purposefully given her her digital privacy, but during the night I admit I checked her iPad messages. There didn't seem to be any on messenger. When I got to work, I pulled up our cell phone account that I manage and looked at her text log. I ran a reverse phone number search to ID the most often texted number and founf that it did belong to \"the guy\" She had texted with him before she left to go out, right before she left to come home, and first thing in the morning. I looked back further and found that she often texted with him before bed and first thing in the morning when she typically has her coffee. The real gut punch though, was when I looked at the call logs. Multiple calls per day with him for weeks, including long calls, some over an hour.\n\nI texted her at work and asked how her day was going. \"Awful on many levels. I deserve it.\"\n\nI told her that we needed to talk and suggested meeting after work before we go home. \"ok\" (lower case) Rechecked the call log and saw two calls to the guy this morning, one before I texted her and one after.\n\nI am just heartbroken and feel like I'm going to be sick. I do love her, but looking back over the past months, I did feel her pulling away. I'm guilty of being online too much in the evenings, but in the past we've always had a solid couple of hours of reconnecting at home after work. Lately, we have been getting home later and skipping a traditional dinner, so we haven't had that daily time consistently.\n\nWhat in the world am I going to say to her tonight? I can't imaging living with anyone else, but I don't know if I can get past this.

He left me for another woman, whom he married very shortly after our divorce was finalized.\n\nI'm the first to admit that our marriage was over long before she came around but I can't help but hate her. We were married young. I was 18 and he was 19. He was in the military. Once he got out, I think we were both different people who had grown apart. Suffice it to say, I got pregnant with our first child in 2013 and our second in 2015. We fought constantly, I demanded that he sleep in the guest room. He was always working supporting our family and looking back, I took him foregranted. He did his best to support us and I didn't treat him like the husband he deserved to be. We were essentially roommates raising two kids and the environment we were raising them in was pretty volatile. Even if we did try counseling, I'm not it would have helped.\n\nSince he abruptly left, he has been an active part of their lives. He never missed a child support payment and sees them per the terms of our custody agreement, which is every other weekend and alternating holidays. He also gets them for several weeks each summer. \n\nThe kids love their time at their dads and love their step mom as well. They talk about their time there very positively and I'm happy for that. I'm happy that they have a warm environment, a ton of toys, cute clothes, opportunities to see the world, all with 2 people who seem to genuinely prioritize their marriage and love one another.\n\nWhat I struggle with is I feel like I've been robbed. I look at their life and compare it to my own. I see a woman who my husband left me for. She's tall, beautiful, has the best clothes, has a successful career and loves my kids. It seems like the two of them have the happy, positive relationship I yearned for with my husband at the time. I'm jealous and I'm angry. For christ sake, even their 2 dogs are adorable and perfect\n\nMore so than that, I've struggled since he left to provide financially and I can't take them on fancy vacations and all of the things my ex and his new wife are able to do.  I only have 1 income and it's modest. Both of their careers have taken off in the past few years and seem to be doing well for themselves.\n\nEvery time I pull up to drop off the kids, I see their massive, beautiful home (I've been inside and it's immaculate). They both drive new bmws. They go on 3 or 4 vacations a year that are anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks (sometimes the kids come, sometimes they don't). Every time, it's inevitable for me to see pictures of them and the kids in Europe, South America, the Caribbean, and wherever else. It hurts because I feel like the woman in those pictures should be me. I hate this woman with every fiber of my being for taking my husband away from me but at the same time, respect her for welcoming 2 my babies into her life and treating them as her own. I still want to stab her though.\n\nVery recently, after picking up my kids from a weekend at dads, they were so excited to tell me that their step mom is pregnant with twins and they were going to have not one, but two new brothers or sisters. I felt like I was just punched in the stomach. All of the feelings I experienced when my ex-husband left the first time came back. The flood gates opened and once I got home, I bawled my eyes out. \n\nIt's been 3 years since we split up. I should be over this. I shouldn't have these feelings but just don't know how to stop feeling the way I do. I wish therapy was an option but I just can't afford, even with insurance. My family listens but I know I'm probably a broken record at this point. Also, I have no one to blame but myself for letting my marriage spin out of control like it did. How do you rectify that?

Caught sperm donor banging his mistress (now wife) in my parents' bed. My mother ended up miscarrying and she was heavily pregnant. Sperm donor announced mistress was pregnant and that he loved her. Parents divorced. Mother went through a depressive episode. I almost lost her. I managed to survive through the court ordered visitations . Had no relationship with mistress turned wife and half sister. I finally moved to another country when I was 15. Mother married my wonderful stepfather and had my two little brothers. I stopped all contact with sperm donor once I moved to the new country. \n\nI'm 21 now and life was (is) finally good after years of pain &amp; hurt. \n\nWell last year, half sister got diagnosed with late stage leukemia. She passed away on the morning of my 21st birthday. \n\nI didn't feel affected in anyway, and although I felt sad that she passed away, It was almost like some distant relative that I never talk to passing away. I went ahead with my 21st birthday party and celebrated with friends and family. Had a great time. \n\nBecause of half sister's passing, I decided to not to put up the pictures on social media. Someone posted those pictures and mistress turned wife came across them. She said a lot of hurtful things about me and my mom on Facebook and also accused me of celebrating her daughter's death. She ended her rant by wishing death upon me. \n\n\nWell. I'm not proud of this , but I went nuclear. I exposed sperm donor and mistress turned wife and listed down all the hurtful things they did to me back when I was kid. I finally ended my post by disowning my father, and said that he was dead to me. \n\n\nI thought I made myself clear when I said that, but apparently sperm donor doesn't take no for an answer. He tried calling me back when the entire shit show went down, but I refused to talk to him. \n\nNow it has been 2 weeks since it all went down and things returned to normal in my life, when suddenly out of the blue, sperm donor SHOWED UP to my HOME lastnight , wanting to talk to me. I have no idea how he got our address. \n\nMy mother wasn't home. I was there with my stepfather and brothers. Well, he started crying, asking my step dad to convince me to come downstairs to meet him. I refused. He continued with his bullshit for 3 hours. Crying, shouting, begging.\n\nFinally my stepfather threatened to call the police and he left. My mother got home today morning and is telling me to meet him. He is here in this country for a week and according to my mother, he just wants to see me once before he returns. I don't want to see his face ever again in my life. I was finally happy. I don't want to deal with his toxic presence, but my mother is insisting I talk to him once. \n\nI'm at my wits end. Please give me some advice.

I thought it might take more time/more sessions to get to the nitty gritty so booked a few more. \n\nThe next session fell on a religious holiday and she happened to ask what my religious preferences were. I told her, and she began telling me how people need spirituity to have a purpose in life, and how she herself has aligned with several religions in her lifetime. I have no problem her telling me that, but she then progressed to tell me that Jesus is her guide and got quite emotional and started crying. \n\nI felt really uncomfortable and suddenly felt guilty talking about myself when the person I'm in the room with was visibly upset. \n\nRegardless, I don't have much choice with mental help here so booked another session with her a week later. She didn't cry or bring up religion again, but our conversations feel very much like general chit chat with not a lot of psychoanalysis going on. \n\nLike I say, I've never had therapy before so no idea if this is normal? Or if you have to stick it out a while to start getting to the analysis part? \n\nBut most importantly I want to know if my concerns over unprofessionalism are valid? Are there any red flags here? Should I find another way to seek mental help as there aren't many options for English speakers here? \n\nTIA", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2132616, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should I drop my therapist because she cried and divulged her religious preferences in my session?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572171094, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkxf4q/should_i_drop_my_therapist_because_she_cried_and/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "missesbitch", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11y391", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571643409, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkwz4k/is_it_normal_for_a_hookup_to_bring_their_kid_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dkwz4k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 91, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkwz4k/is_it_normal_for_a_hookup_to_bring_their_kid_with/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571643409, "score": 282, "selftext": "So it's 1:17 AM and my roommate had a guy come over to hang out with.

I have a very hard time opening up to people and being myself. I understand this is rooted in a severely traumatic and abusive childhood, but lately, I have been wondering just how bad it was and if it was truly devoid of any love or care.\n\nIt started with the way my parents treated me, which I will dive into more in the following paragraphs. I came to recognize their mental health issues and abuse, but I thought they loved and cared about me, or were at least trying to. I'm beginning to think they were traitors from the moment I was born and never had an ounce of care for me, nor will they ever.\n\nBoth my parents were raised in very dysfunctional environments. My father and mother had abusive, schizophrenic, psychotic parents. My mother is a Jehovahs Witness and a therapist, while my father is a doctor. My mother used to be married but divorced after she cheated on her previous husband. My father I've come to learn has serious issues and sees my mother like his replacement \"mommy\" (he was adopted by an abusive mother), while my mother seems him as a resource for the money he makes.\n\nWhen I was young, I was in my room nearly daily. I would spend all my time in there because I was always being punished for bad behavior. I was also constantly put on new medicines to control my behavior. I didn't understand this because anytime I would come back from another family's house (the rare times it happened) they would always go to my parents and tell them how well-behaved I was. My father would make a stern remark, playing it off as a joke, saying \"He just acts like that... wait till you see him at home.\" At home I was just very terrified and lonely above all else.\n\nThis upbringing was severely isolating, and it felt like solitary confinement from birth until about 12 years old. Every single day was locked in the room, waiting for something horrible to happen. And because my mom was a Jehovahs Witness, and raised my brother and I in the religion, I was socially isolated and had few if none friends. None that I could play with anyways because they could never come over to this house. So I just spend all my time alone, in my room, being punished.\n\nMy father was disturbing and abusive. I would have to constantly fight him and my brother, and defend myself. He would come to my room on a daily basis, bang the door, and try and break in, while I would fight to hold the door back. If he did come in he would \"spank me\" (hit me) until I was numb, as hard as he could.\n\nI felt he mistreated our animals too that he got. He would punish our dog like he punished me, locking her in dark places for a long time before he let her out. She had been abused before with a massive jagged scar on her back, I think my parents noticed this when they adopted her and so they picked her out because she was a good target for them. She ended up dying, I think, of neglect. Her hip muscles stopped working and she couldn't move around. They didn't even put an ounce of effort into finding out why.... It was very clear. They had a dog door set up for her about 5 feet off the ground that was far too small. Every time she needed to go to the bathroom shed have to jump through it and youd hear a really loud bang as she hit her hips one the side. \n\nI suffered more every day in the isolation, I went a little crazy, I started fantasizing, living in a fantasy world. I was bullied at school and an outcast, even though I came to realize many people liked me, I was just very closed off and derealized because of what was going on at home and in the wacky religion. It led me to not even understand how relationships worked or basic communication.\n\nAs I got older all this started taking a toll and I struggled to even live in the world. People looked like monsters, I couldn't tell what was and wasn't real, and etc. I got a very good therapist who helped me out with it all, and things got better, but I have since been financially deprived by my family and cannot afford one. I have fought very hard to overcome these things and have a job now. I am financially independent and my income grows daily. I am about to graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science.\n\nOther crazy things were my mother flirting with me. I felt like prey around her while she was a predator. She would go through my private belongings, my drawers, invade my space. She was always very flirtatious with me and it made me very uncomfortable. I think she is a sociopath, or a psychopath. I think she became a therapist to learn how to better control and manipulate people. She had no moral compass.\n\nMy father was just cruel and I think he was especially mad with me because he felt like my mom was taking attention away from him. He was basically a child mentally and so he would target me more, try and humiliate me in front of her, just like she would already humiliate me.\n\nHe hid a camera in my room when I was younger and interacting with a friend. He showed me the recording afterwards and told me that I was bad at socializing, and shamed me. It felt disturbing knowing he was secretly recording me.\n\nI had severe stomach issues my whole life too. They would just humiliate and shame me for it, while I suffered. I couldn't eat wheat and other ingredients due to what I learned was IBS. After I moved out it took me a few years, but I solved it with an elimination diet. I was always hungry and starving every day in the house, eating the same three foods over and over, because they would not buy food for me or help me find a way to solve this problem. Yet when my brother always came home they would buy him cinnamon rolls, pastries, cookies.\n\nIt was harsh and neglecting. It was derealizing and splitting. It was off and on, highs and lows, constant crazy behavior. No moment was safe. I have regular nightmares of torture and frequently think about and watch torture because part of me loves it. It is very real to me. But it makes it difficult to connect with others, even if I think I might like them, because nobody relates to this.\n\nIt got even worse at 11, or middle school. My brother (3 years older than me) left the religion we were in and I felt alone and ultimately betrayed by my mother, but I stayed a Jehovah witness for another 4 years. Around this time my brother flipped into a totally different person. We had always fought and not gotten along, but he started outright hating me. He truly wanted nothing to do with me. He would slam the door in my face, ignore me, literally just stopped talking to me... and it stayed that way until he left for college. We haven't had a real conversation since. \n\nAt that time (middle school) I became even more isolated. I stopped talking to people at school and started going to the library and sitting in a desk in the back that was private. I checked out every book on torture and just read all the examples. About botched gas chamber executions that left people screaming and banging their heads on poles. I felt very disturbed reading it but it felt more real than anything else.\n\nEventually I moved and went to college but this past stayed with me. I continued to fight it, and as I said above, got a therapist and things got much better. But then I went into a relationship with a very abusive heroin addict. She held a knife to my throat, tried to cheat on me, I would wake up to her whispering disturbing things in my ear at night... I packed my bags and left that relationship without saying goodbye after 2 years, feeling utterly betrayed when I had given my heart to this person. I shouldn't have stayed even one day.\n\nI had many things I loved in life ripped from me. Relationships, a childhood, sports, academic success, because every second of my life this nightmare was churning and I was battling it. It consumed me an endless number of times though I never gave up, but it ripped everything I loved from me. It gutted and mutilated me.\n\nSo now I am sitting here in agony because I am trying to get beyond this stuff, find good people, start my life, find truly caring relationships. And I feel like to do that I need to expose my past and understand the truth about it. That it was not only abusive but that these \"parents\" were nothing more than people that had absolutely zero care for me. From day one I was on my own surviving in this environment. I am just looking for confirmation of this horror and these realizations from people. \n\nThank you", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2132069, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[24/m] String of important relationships totally devoid of care, feeling tortured", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572168654, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkut5i/24m_string_of_important_relationships_totally/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwRA3333654333", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4t7ercni", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571627719, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkufd8/m33_my_wife_f34_put_herself_in_a_position_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dkufd8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 75, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkufd8/m33_my_wife_f34_put_herself_in_a_position_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571627722, "score": 126, "selftext": "I\u2019m in crisis right now, I have no one to talk to and am getting the dreaded feeling of being lied to. \n\nAn important detail to our relationship is that she had an affair lasting 6 months 5 years ago. She got away with it and then came clean to me after the birth of our second child. Due to feelings of genuine sincerity and wanted to keep my family together we decided to work through it and have been happily married ever since with occasional difficulties. No cheating since.\n\nLast night she went on a girls night and after waking up alone at 3 am I texted and called her when I seen her mobile was located in an apartment building. She wouldn\u2019t not open texts or answer calls. An hour later she went to an address across town. I contacted a mutual friend who got ahold of her and she said she\u2019d leave right away and come home. This was at 5:30 am, she initially insisted on staying the night at a friends but I said I was going to come and get her if she didn\u2019t cab home.\n\nWhen she got home she was pleading ignorance of any wrong doing saying that she was just hanging out with friends. After a lot of fighting and yelling I told her I tracked her location and she said she was at an apartment with a group of guys and a few females. Then she left that party with a female friend and two single men to go back to their house.  She initially said that she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and didn\u2019t acknowledge how damaging that was to our trust until the next morning. She says she didn\u2019t do anything at their house and they were just hanging out talking. I am not naive and know why guys take girls back to their homes at 4:30 am. \n\nShe was apologetic today and acknowledged that she put herself in a position for me to question her fidelity. Yet she maintains innocence with no way of proving it or of me proving she did cheat. \n\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve questioned her since the original affair, I love her desperately and I don\u2019t think I could make it through a divorce and losing my kids. I want to believe her and carry on with my family more than anything but I am terrified that I\u2019m being lied to and further damaging my soul and self esteem.

He asked my wife to move to be his assistant, etc. I didn\u2019t think he was serious but he invited us down in 3rd qtr 2017 to see the city and gave her an offer. We\u2019re both from our home midwestern city, born and raised, I worked at a family business, never thought we\u2019d leave. \n\nWe went, liked it, and thought we\u2019d take the leap. I\u2019ll spare you the details, but there was a lot of back and forth, including her saying she didn\u2019t want to go days before we were to leave. We went and things were rough. I got an offer a month after we moved, but she said to decline it, it wasn\u2019t enough money. I had second thoughts but did decline and keep looking. \n\nOur house finally sold in May of 2018, and we bought a much more expensive house than I wanted to buy. I didn\u2019t have a job and was worried, rightfully so. Her job was going well, she was working a ton, I was job searching 3 days a week and had our kids 2 days a week. Right after we moved, I injured my back, and had to have surgery for a ruptured disc. Meanwhile, I got convinced to try financial advising. I made no money but was promised future riches. Studied for the tests, all that, finally linked back up with the company I got the offer from right after we moved here. They still needed me, I accepted and started in Jan of 2019. \n\nGoing back to her starting her job, she met a guy, VP level, that started the same day. I had coffee with him to network, he even brought me in to interview in the summer of 2018 for three different positions. I wasn\u2019t a fan of him but my wife and him became work friends. He promised me an offer, then recanted the offer, and she was pissed at him. He\u2019s married, two kids, house, the whole deal. I questioned their relationship but never in a million years would I thought she would cheat. \n\nFast forward to this summer. We had a bunch of issues, she said she wanted a divorce. I said fine. The next day we talked it over and promised to work on our relationship. Thing have been improving since July. Sex has increased, I\u2019ve tried hard, sent her flowers, taken her on dates, etc. She\u2019s still working a ton, traveling. She hasn\u2019t seemed fully engaged but she was preparing for a huge conference she had. \nShe gets home from the conference exhausted, as expected. She didn\u2019t text much while there, but I knew she was busy. \n\nFast forward to this weekend. I was gone Friday and Saturday, running an event in NY. We get up, go to the gym together, her FIL is in town, he watches the kids. We get back and I promised my son (6) we could go see Addams Family at the movie theater. I take a shower and look at her phone to get pics of the kids downloaded to my phone from their couple days together and see her \u201chidden\u201d folder has a bunch of files. I check it out and it\u2019s screenshots of her texts with the guy at work. Talking about how gorgeous she is, how they\u2019re gonna make out in the hideout, etc. I start feeling ill but go to the movie and dinner with her, our kids, and my father in law. I\u2019m quiet and they asking what\u2019s going on, etc. I say I\u2019m feeling sick and I was BC of what I saw. \n\nI have no idea what to do. Do I confront her, talk to a lawyer first, put something on her phone to spy on texts, etc? I\u2019m heartbroken for myself but more so for my kids, who are now in this situation.

I loved her, got my shit together and we have been great parents (with a lot of help and support from our families). Our daughter is 5 and a half now, and the best thing that has ever happened to me.\n\nMy wife has bipolar disorder and very intense depression. She has been a stay at home mom for the past 4 years, and it has been tough. She\u2019s emotional, quick to react and can be unbelievably mean and vindictive. On the other side, the highs are high and we are passionately in love. Lately that has been less common, and the past year has been really hard. More bad days than good. She can\u2019t be reasoned with, she\u2019s always the victim, and she never takes personal accountability for her actions after the fact.\n\nI am not perfect - I know that. However, I own up to my mistakes and I am accountable for them (overly frustrated, quick to blame, too opinionated). I provide for the three of us and work extremely hard. She never leans in with home cleaning, cooking, and hardly can get out bed to play with, take care of, or be there for our daughter. I know she loves her so much though and she tries her best. For example, during my daughters summer break in between preschool and kindergarten they spent almost every day inside until I came home from work. They went to the park a total of 2 times, my wife never has gone to get groceries without me, and never takes our daughter to do fun activities in the vibrant city we live in (despite constant encouragement to do so on my end).\n\nI have really been trying, but it is so hard. I feel bad for our daughter and would do anything for her - I am pushing myself to the absolute limit to provide. Outside of the bipolar personality, my wife has extreme social anxiety in all situations, is jealous and doesn\u2019t approve of me socializing outside of our marriage. She has problems drinking too much (never stopping); and it leads to her being aggressive and making self deprecating choices. She drinks every day. I always ask her to cool it. I drink too; but it doesn\u2019t affect me like it does her. In her drunken rage she has made suicidal comments, hit me, broken things, and even pulled out a knife and tried to harm herself until I intervened.\n\nI had a work trip come up unexpectedly to a tropical island, and she was upset with me and demanded to come. We bent over backwards to align family members to take care of our daughter for the week and to take her to school and all of her activities. I was cautiously optimistic but excited, hoping we could use this opportunity to turn things around. Just as I was worried about, on our first night here her drinking got out of hand and she got extremely aggressive. I managed to get her to come with me in the Uber back to our resort (this is a notoriously unsafe place in the Caribbean, especially for an attractive woman at night). However, when I got to the elevator to our room I turned around and realized she had gone (to the bar). She exchanged a few texts with me saying to stop being not fun and join her, and I told her I was going to sleep - this week is intensely busy for me (work trip). I woke up a few hours later (1am) and she still wasn\u2019t in the room. I called 5+ times over the next hour to no response. I got really worried. Walked the resort to find her. Assumed the worst. At 2:45a she came back to the hotel and told me she made friends with some flight staff in the bar and went to their room to party. She was acting odd and that clearly is not okay given the circumstance.\n\nShe passed out. Her phone was blowing up with Snapchat notifications (I didn\u2019t even know she had it) and my curiosity got the best of me. I saw her chat thread with her best friend - my wife told her she was going to cheat on me and her friend said absolutely do not, and to go back to our room. To think about our daughter. To not break up our family because of a regretful drunken night. My wife said no, she was going to do it, that he was so sexy, so delicious, and that she was \u201ctotally cheating on ___ (me), please don\u2019t tell\u201d. \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep all night. Mortified. She woke up and tried to cuddle me. I confronted her and gave her the chance to be honest with me - she denied it, I showed her the screenshot I sent myself of her messages. She denied it again, said it didnt happen. Finally admitted that she only kissed him. Said she was in a room with other people, nothing else happened. Got mad and defensive.\n\nI asked her to leave and said to fly home today - I need space. I can\u2019t leave here without jeopardizing  my job (our only income). She won\u2019t leave. She\u2019s bawling, remorseful, begging forgiveness. She says she will stop drinking.\n\nI am at a loss. I love her, but I can\u2019t trust her. Things have been hard, and I truly feel it has been unfair to me and to our daughter. I don\u2019t have friends to confide in (she doesn\u2019t really let me). I don\u2019t want to talk to my parents until I know what my choice is - they are judgemental and immature. Im terrified of how she will be if we divorced, and I can\u2019t even fathom helping my daughter understand. I\u2019m in a lot of debt - no savings, grinding to make it by. Please help provide your candid opinions. She\u2019s in our hotel room and has been hung over and throwing up all day. She won\u2019t stop texting me. I feel bad. I have to be here for 6 more days.

Girlfriend &amp; I have been together for nearly 7 months. Things have been up &amp; down. A few big arguments which mostly happen when one of us is drunk, but most of the time, things are really great!\n\nGF &amp; her ex were together for 3 years &amp; split up about 2 months before we got together, although GF said she tried splitting a few times but he was abusive. He broke her jaw &amp; beat up her dad during the relationship. When we started going out, he\u2019d ring constantly &amp; would bombard her in person if she was alone. Then when I started showing my face in the pub they go in, he\u2019d be polite &amp; stay away (shows what kind of man he is). GF changed her number about 5 months ago &amp; I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been in contact since.\n\nSo today I got home &amp; immediately drove to her house. She\u2019s going to see a band tonight so I knew I\u2019d only see her for an hour or so. We were talking &amp; she brought up that her ex wasn\u2019t going (so she didn\u2019t have to leave the band early). Then she said her dad told her EX wasn\u2019t going and that\u2019s how she knew. Now I\u2019ll admit, the insecure paranoid boy inside me felt something off &amp; so when she went to the bathroom, I had a look at her phone (major trust issues from me, but I\u2019ve been good in this relationship). She\u2019d been WhatsApp-Ing him this afternoon. I know it was the first time since she changed her number because the first text from him was \u201cwho\u2019s this?\u201d\n\nThey sent about 20-30 texts each &amp; apparently it was her way of \u201cfinding out where he was tonight\u201d because her dad \u201cwouldn\u2019t tell her.\u201d  The texts were like so:\nEX: I\u2019m going to see a band @ b\nGF: I\u2019m going to see x band @ y\nEX: Is he going with you?\nGF: who\u2019s he?\nEX: the lad you\u2019ve been seeing\nGF: no I\u2019m going with my dad\n\nI stormed out and eventually replied to her texts with this...\n\n\u201cYou gave your abusive ex boyfriend your number that you changed to get away from him and then told him you were seeing a band you both know without me. He will 100% turn up &amp; will cling to you until you cut him out for good. I on the other hand have already decided that\u2019s it. Have a nice life\u201d\n\nShe replied \u201cI didn\u2019t want him turning up and you being there! It\u2019s always been to protect you! Are you actually breaking up with me?\u201d\n\nHave I over-reacted or should I just keep running &amp; not look back?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2130798, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (24m) broke up with my girlfriend (25f) for texting her ex(23m) boyfriend.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572162216, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dknwms/i_24m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_25f_for_texting/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRA1638363839", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4l991ywn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571596145, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dknkn8/my_bf_is_becoming_increasingly_clingy_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dknkn8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 39, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dknkn8/my_bf_is_becoming_increasingly_clingy_and/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571596146, "score": 104, "selftext": "My bf (40) and I (34) have been dating for a little over 3 years.  When we met he was a pretty big hot mess and hadn\u2019t dated anyone officially for 7 years or so.  He dated a girl in his 20s for 8 years and it ended with her rejecting his proposal and breaking up with him.  He completely fell apart.  He\u2019s really sweet and good looking and charming so he basically played the field for those 7 years to avoid getting close to anyone.  It kinda bothered me at first because when we met he had a lot of \u201cfriends\u201d that he had also hooked up with and were constantly blowing up his phone.  I know a lot of these chics hated me when when we finally became official because it was a \u201cwhat does she have that I don\u2019t have\u201d type of situation.  But we worked through all that and have had a really great partnership for the past few years.\n\nFor the first 2 to 2.5 years there was a lot of emotional withdraw and me working to get him to be comfortable in a happy relationship again.  Totally understandable, he was a really hurt and was very cautious of opening up to someone.  Now that we have worked through it, he\u2019s getting more and more clingy and overly lovey lovey, to the point where I\u2019m feeling suffocated.  He\u2019s very touchy whenever we go out, I feel like I shouldn\u2019t complain but he\u2019ll constantly stop me and hold my face to stare in my eyes and tell me how much he loves me and how much I mean to him. I 100% want that every-once in a while but it\u2019s just too much at this point.\n\nWe had a weird day yesterday.  We went to a local wine festival with a couple friends of ours.  As we were walking around we ran into a group of women from his work.  Now I know one of the girls because he slept with her right before we became official and this chic would not let it go.  Their offices are next to each other and he was like I can\u2019t just stop talking to her but she kept calling and texting him to the point that I got really upset and he had to sit her down and tell her she was blocking her number.  That was a year ago so they are generally friendly again...I mean they have to see each other every single day so he tries to be nice.  I can tell by stories my bf shares she def hasn\u2019t let it go.  She bought him an elaborate personal gift for his bday (I wasn\u2019t super happy about that) and will surprise him with lunch and coffee.  The rest of the girls in the group are her friends so they know the story.  Women can be very mean.  It was a very odd interaction in general and as I introduced myself to everyone in the group I could feel the stink eyes.  We walked away and I mentioned to my bf that I knew exactly who that was and that the reception was not friendly.  He told me to forget about it but it just put me in kinda an off mood.\n\nWe finished the night going out to a club in the city.  My stomach was just being kinda weird from the earlier interaction and probably a bit too much wine at the festival so I was nauseous most of the time at the club.  I hate telling my bf if I don\u2019t feel well because he makes it a big deal and gets upset when he can\u2019t fix it.  I opted to not drink at the club but I still needed to make multiple trips to the bathroom.  I would come back to the dance floor and my bf was constantly all over me, wanting to make out and dance.  He will say things like \u201cyour the reason my heart beats\u201d, \u201cyour the reason I fight through each day\u201d, and constant \u201cI love you\u201d over and over again.  I feel like an asshole for being freaked out but it\u2019s too much.\n\nI know from his previous breakup he tried to commit suicide when they broke up.  He\u2019s shared with me the story.  So he\u2019ll make comments like \u201cyour the reason I\u2019m alive\u201d and it just totally freaks me out. I don\u2019t like that amount of pressure and feeling like if we ever did break up that he wouldn\u2019t be ok.  I ended up going to the bathroom at the end of the night and puking my brains out.  I feel like it was the combo of the weird day earlier and feeling smothered when we were together.  I came out of the bathroom feeling awful and as soon as I walked out he was waiting there and was immediately all over me kissing me.  I don\u2019t want to kiss someone after I just threw up.  The pressure from the hugs was hurting my stomach.\n\nWe finally got back to the car with his friends and even in the back seat and he was trying to be all cuddled up (now he did have a few drinks so he was a bit more over the top that usual).  I just wanted to close my eyes and let the nausea pass.  When we got home in my head I was like I\u2019ve got to tell him he needs to back off and I\u2019m feeling really smothered.  I just told him I want to get in bed.  I turned down the offer to cuddle and for a massage.  I was like \u201chon please I just need to lie down and go to sleep.  I don\u2019t feel well\u201d.  He tucked me into bed and got all upset that he failed as a bf at taking care of me.  He started tearing up and I\u2019m trying to calm him down and tell him I\u2019m fine.  Its ok.  After 15 minutes I got him to go take a shower so i could finally sleep.  I woke up a few hours later and he was curled up in our guest bed because he thought I didn\u2019t want him in the bed with me.  I got him to get in bed and we went to sleep.\n\nJesus what do I do here?  He went from mr. sauve player that every girl was chasing and I was the lucky winner to a sad puppy dog begging for my approval every day.  I love him more than I\u2019ve loved anyone before but he\u2019s pushing me away by smothering me.  I\u2019m going to have a talk with him about love languages to start and that words of affirmation and physical touch are probably lower on my list to things like acts of service (bring me my favorite chocolate or run a load of laundry!!).  I haven\u2019t had this convo earlier because I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll have a melt down.  We have gone and tried on a few engagement rings but haven\u2019t picked anything yet so I need to get this worked out before we get to that point.  His family adores me and I adore them and want to solve this before it ends in a breakup.

One day when we got together with our youngest sister, and half-sister we had fun, ate and drank abit. When we started to discusses our lives, work, relationships etc, Jane(in a slightly drunken state) told us that she has had sex with over a hundred married men. At first I thought she was just joking but when she explained it I instantly knew she was serious. She told us that quite a lot of these men are her clients, she's a solicitor(it's what we call lawyers in the U.K). She told me that she's also had sex with married colleagues, a long affair with an employer when she worked in retail years ago, married neighbours, guys she met on dating website looking to cheat etc. Then she showed us a few videos of her having sex with different men and you can see their wedding ring clearly so I know she was telling the truth. She told me that she has friends who do this and they have created a joke-type game together pertaining to sleeping with married men. She was smiling as she said that and it just made me feel awful.\n\nThen she showed us a video where she accompanied one of her friends who had to meet up with a married man she had an affair with, after his wife caught him. In the video the women flips out, cries and hurls abuse at the friend for sleeping with her husband then walks away with her husband to their car. My sister follows them out and zooms into them and you can see the women crying on her husbands shoulder as they hug and my sister and her friends are just laughing at the women calling her \"pathetic bitch\" among many other other things. I was disgusted by that video and by how my sister narrated the events.\n\nI genuinely can't believe that my beloved sis would do something like this.

He told me that the things i was doing was suffocating, clingy, and needy (This was the first time anyone\u2019s ever called me that. But maybe i was, i try my best to see both sides of a situation, even if i don\u2019t want to, although i don\u2019t think the things i did were really that clingy honestly, but back to the story). I\u2019m just really confused because a few months before that convo, he told me that i wasn\u2019t putting enough effort into the relationship, and that i needed to do more such as making some plans and texting first, etc. \n\nSo when he told me that i wasn\u2019t doing enough, i did everything in my power to make sure that i listened to what he told me, because i love him and i wanted to make sure he was happy.  \n\nBut then months later, he dropped the suffocating comment on me. Said that I\u2019m always texting him, always trying to make plans whenever he wants to relax, but i didn\u2019t bring up what he said in the initial convo because i was so shocked at what he said. I told him a few days later how i felt about his comment, and all i got was a back handed apology. (More of a, \u201csorry you feel that way\u201d). \n\nSince that conversation, I\u2019ve let up pretty much completely when it came to the texting and making plans. I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells with him, so i don\u2019t bother doing anything at all. He\u2019s starting to become more affectionate and lovey-dovey since the \u201csuffocating\u201d convo, but honestly, I\u2019ve felt more and more over it. \n\nUPDATE: So we talked last night, and he said that he\u2019s so stressed out with work, and he\u2019s struggling mentally and financially as well (he looked like he\u2019s been crying for a while before i came over) and also said that it has nothing to do with me, that I\u2019m an amazing person and that it\u2019s not fair to me that he\u2019s not making me a priority, basically a \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d breakup, and he was crying the entire time. I honestly felt bad for him. And to be real, i was fine the entire time we were having the breakup. Didn\u2019t cry or anything. I know it sounds like I\u2019m a sociopath, but I\u2019m not i swear lol. Idk whether he was telling the truth as to why were breaking up or not, but at this point, it is what it is. Wished him nothing but the best, hope he gets to a point where he wants to be in life.\n\nI\u2019m now a little happy because now I\u2019ve thought of places for solo traveling, self-care ideas, and other things that i want to do, just cause i want to. Let\u2019s see what the future holds!\n\nTL:DR: Bf broke up with me, theme of said breakup convo was \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d.

I said I would rather not go, but my girlfriend wanted to, so I did. My girlfriend can not handle her drink, so I told her I would take her home if she became drunk, and she agreed and told me to, saying it\u2019d be best.\n\nShe has became too drunk before and pulled similar stunts, which have caused major issues for us. She\u2019s even taken drugs secretly before whilst out which I have threatened to leave her over.\n\nSo we\u2019re out, having a good time. Everything is peachy. She goes off dancing with her friends and I\u2019m sat in a booth with mine.\n\nAn hour later her friend approaches me and tells me she has disappeared. Naturally I\u2019m worried, and I begin searching high and low. But it\u2019s a big club, so it takes a while.\n\nThen, I witness my girlfriend sprint across the stage, pursued by three security guards. She is tackled and carried away to a back room.\n\nAfter begging with another security guard to be let backstage to see her, he eventually lets me.\n\nThe site i find is not pretty; she is lying there, covered in vomit, passed out. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was beyond pissy and apologised to the security guards, one of which was covered in sick. I paid him \u00a3200 to cover the cost of his clothes.\n\nAt this point she woke up once again, threw up on my shoes, and then passed back out. They ask me if she had taken any drugs, and I said not to my knowledge but that it\u2019s possible.\n\nI took her home, dirtying the inside of my car, and put her to bed. Well, on her bed. I slept in her en suite bathroom with a window open to escape the pungent smell.\n\nShe fell asleep, woke up briefly and is still asleep now, over twelve hours later.\n\nAny ideas on how I should talk to her or what I should do?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2130540, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [18M] girlfriend [18F] embarrassed herself in a club last night and now I think I want to break up", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572160354, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dklugn/my_18m_girlfriend_18f_embarrassed_herself_in_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rando1789", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4u7ctn3z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571588511, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dklsp3/my_wife_just_came_out_to_me_as_bi_and_im_ok_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dklsp3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 171, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dklsp3/my_wife_just_came_out_to_me_as_bi_and_im_ok_with/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571588514, "score": 160, "selftext": "My (29M) wife (28F) recently came out to me as being bi.

Now my sister and gf are almost the same age but my gf, on paper, is a lot more accomplished than my sister. She has a degree from an excellent university and has a great job cause she studied something that's currently in demand but quite niche and makes a good amount of money especially considering her age. I'm very proud of her honestly. I know she has worked very very hard to accomplish all this. My sister on the other hand, did not try at college at kind of just skated by. By her own admission she didn't do enough and now she cannot find a \"proper job\" (as she refers to it. She just can't get one that would pay her the amount she would like to be making). She does have a job but she thinks this job is not \"worthy\" of her and I don't think she puts in much effort. \n\nNow gf and I were happy to have her but..I've been noticing that she can be quite rude to my gf at times and make passive aggressive comments towards her. She could simply invite my sister to dinner if we are going out and my sister would take that as my gf showing off and she the last time actually said \"don't need your charity\". She makes comments that imply my gf is a show off a lot. My gf really is not one to show off or be particularly confrontational so she just lets it be but I know she is tired of hearing those comments. My sister has also been making jokes about how my gf is my sugar mummy even though my gf has told her those jokes make her uncomfortable. I have spoken to my sister about not being a dick to my gf and also tell her off if she says anything while I'm there (and told my gf to do the same).\n\nLast week she actually took things too far and kept calling my gf a posh princess and kept making the sugar mummy jokes and my gf got upset (she normally ignores) and told my sister that people are normally nice to people who hosts them at their homes. I thought it was a pretty mild jab at my sister but she got really angry and yelled at gf about how it was her brothers place and not hers and sarcastically said sorry for not having a posh life like my gf. Gf got upset and left. And I told my sister that if sje wants to stay with us, she needs to learn to be nicer and get along with my gf. My sister got mad at me after that. \n\nMy sister must've told my parents cause my mother called and asked me why I was \"kicking out\" my sister and how my gf is changing me and making me not considerate of my family etc etc. Sister is still hostile to gf and she just tries to avoid all this. She has been staying at work longer and has been sending me listings for places that my sister can move out to. \n\nI love my gf to death and honestly do not want anything to ruin it even a little bit. I also love my sister but I think her jealousy of my gf is really ruining out relationship. I don't want to throw her out either but I need my gf to feel comfortable in her owm home. I also need my parents to back off. I don't know how to resolve this without fucking up any of these relationships?

I\u2019m hoping this right subreddit. My post it seems like it\u2019s going make people upset. I ask that the mods here please reframe from removing this post, even if things get heated. I really want to get all the advise, I can get and make myself better. Thank you in advance. Everything pass this paragraph is exactly what I posted on the previous post. All of the events happened yesterday night. \n\nToday has literally been the most depressing day of my life. I\u2019m sobbing right now, feeling alone as I type this. Please be gentle in your responses. I\u2019m extremely sensitive right now. I apologize for any errors in advance. I [F30] have been married to my husband [M31] for 6 years and have been together for a total of 8 years. \n\nToday was supposed to be a date night for us since we always seem busy. I work from home and was able to finish up all of my admin work early, so I decided to surprise my husband by cooking all of his favorite foods and make a buffet sort of thing. It took almost 2-3 hours of preparations, but everything came out perfect and just in time before my husband came home. I quickly showered, did my hair, put on make-up, and picked out an outfit that he has told me is one of his favorites to see me in. \n\nHe came home on time as expected. I was so excited to surprise him. He says thanks and we sit down together. I thought tonight would be perfect. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been planning for a while. Then I hear the dreaded words come  from his mouth, \u201cI want a divorce\u201d. I think it took me a moment to register that this was real. My mind goes blank, then I get this rush of depression and sadness that just kicks in.\n\nI ask, while sobbing, why does he want a divorce and ensure that I will give him my full understanding so we can try to fix this issue. He explains to me I always rejected him of sex, always said no, always made false promises to fix myself, and always made excuses. He then goes on and explains that he always tried talking to me about it and it never helped. I realize that he is completely right. I always said no, I always made excuses, and always made false promises to change. When I look back on all the times I said no to sex, I can say my husband was a very patient man. I have no excuses. I went to my gynecologist last year, per my husband\u2019s request, to check to see if there was anything causing me to have a low libido. The doctor ensured that everything was good. \n\nI remember one time my husband unexpectedly came home on his lunch break and asked if he wanted to have sex. I shouted at him because \u201cI thought you came home because you wanted to spend time with me, not to get laid.\u201d He then made me lunch and went back to work. I realize now that he wanted to reconnect with me in a way he reserved exclusively for us. I never apologized for snapping at him. The fact he stilled cared enough to make me lunch without me asking speaks volumes, despite what just happened.\n\nI ensure my husband that his feelings are valid. I apologize for all the hurt and pain that I cause him. I promise to try harder and not just put make false promises. I admit to making excuses and being selfish in the relationship. I told him I will do whatever it takes, whether it\u2019s therapy, scheduling sex, etc. I didn\u2019t realize that it was hurting my husband this bad. (Side note: I didn\u2019t say this to my husband because he mentioned divorce. I said it because it\u2019s truly how I feel. I had a realization at the time.) My husband then explains that he has given me multiple chances and how alone I have made him feel. \n\nI try to remind him of our marriage vows that we took, that we would always be together through the good and the bad. He then retorts that part of the vows that we took that we wouldn\u2019t deprive each other of sex and that sex is an exchange for loyalty. He then explains that he has felt so lonely, that he\u2019s wanting to cheat but he wasn\u2019t going to lower himself to that, as he put it. I tried to reassure him of everything. He then starts to pack all of his clothes, as I\u2019m following him around the house begging him now to go, explaining that I\u2019ll do anything it takes to keep us together. I even offer him sex right now. He declines it. He then takes what little he packs and is informing me that he is staying with his parents until he gets a place of his own. \n\nI try calling and texting my husband multiple times, but I get meet with this text message and his exact words are \u201cI don\u2019t believe you will ever change. I will never forget all of times you lied about changing. I will never forget how the few times we had sex, it\u2019s because I had to beg you for it. You just laid there like a starfish. When you went to Gynecologist, I thought it was going to real change, but should of known better. I remember when we first met, you couldn\u2019t keep your hands off of me. As soon as we got married, you became way too comfortable in our marriage and put forth less effort. You robbed me of my 20s of sex. I will not loose my 30s to a sexless marriage. I refuse to grow old and regret my life decisions. You had your chance. We maybe legally married, but we are officially over. If I decide to have sex with someone right now, it would not be considered cheating. That is how serious I am about this. I will be sending you divorce papers soon. Goodbye, forever [my name]!\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve continued trying to call my husband multiple times, but it keeps on going to voicemail. He either has his phone off or has blocked me. He will not respond to me on Facebook Messenger and Snapchat either. I\u2019m sitting hear all alone with all of the untouched food I made just for him. \n\nI really don\u2019t want this marriage to end. We have so much history. I love him with all of my heart, he always been a great man, and I can\u2019t see my life without him. What can I do to fix this, before it\u2019s too late? All I can do is sit here and cry. I can\u2019t lose him. In case anyone is wondering, we do not have any kids. Any advice is appreciated. \n\nEDIT: I also want to explain to people while I had a low libido. At one point about a year after getting married, I was working full time and sometimes they had mandatory overtime, going to school to get my Bachelors Degree (spending 60-80 hours a week on school and work), and taking care of my mother who was dying from ALS who couldn\u2019t even do basic functions such as walk, talk, use the bathroom, and cook without assistance. A typical day for me was getting up at 5 in the morning, and not going to bed until midnight, sometimes later. Constantly getting 4-5 hours asleep will drain you. This is all on top of being a wife. Making sure we go on dates, spend time together, help take care of the house, provide, etc. Sometimes I was busy, I missed out on sleep just to get my school work done because I was busy taking care of my mom. My husband only worked 40 hours, and had way more free time. It wasn\u2019t because he was lazy. He took care of the house and pets, but he didn\u2019t have school and I wouldn\u2019t let him take care of my mother because it was my job. In fact sometime he would get on me for constantly pushing it. When my mother passed away, it emotionally affect me. It still does today, but it\u2019s way more manageable. I\u2019m not saying this as an excuse. I could of tried to make more time for husband. God knows he deserves it. \n\nWe had sex on average 1-2 times a month. I truly enjoyed the intimacy when it happened. But when you\u2019re exhausted, sex rarely will come on my mind. In text message, my husband mentioned me just laying there like a star fish. I believe he is referring to a fight we had 2-3 years ago where we were having sex, I was just letting him do his thing. I was slowly getting into, but it was hard to. The previous night my mother fell and I had to rush to her house to pick her up. Keep in mind, ALS prevents you from basic functions such as walking. I spent the night at my mother\u2019s, but I didn\u2019t get much sleep, probably didn\u2019t fall asleep until 2-3 in the morning and I had to be up by 5 to be on time for work. I tried to explain it, but constantly rejecting my husband for years, I understand why he was upset. \n\nMy libido over this past year has slowly been coming back now that I don\u2019t feel emotional drained. I\u2019m graduated, have more free time and working a normal 40 hour week (working mostly from home cutting my travel time), and I\u2019m healing from my mother\u2019s death. It\u2019s been about a year since her passing, and I\u2019m back to a normal sleep cycle. Since yesterday, I\u2019ve scheduled to see a psychologist to help me with my libido and to improve myself and I scheduled to see my gynecologist again just to be double sure there is no underlying medical issues causing a low libido, Lastly, even though I\u2019m not fat, I plan on hitting the gym again. I used to be very athletic, but that was a while back.\n\n**TL;DR:** My husband said that we are not sexually compatible and wants a divorce. He has left me alone in the house and he informed me that he is moving in with his parents until he can find a place of his own. I admit to my mistake and ensured I\u2019m more than willing to work on my libido, but he doesn\u2019t believe me.

But after reading the replies, I realized how not ok this phone thing was. My boyfriend always had this habbit of minimizing my problems so I always thought I was being overdramatic. Like how he told me can't ever let me finish because women's bodies are more complicated than a man's. Or how condoms are uncomfortable and the pullout method works, etc. He's not my first sexual partner, but i didn't know much about sex until we start dated so my whole perception is kinda warped. All those things bothered me but I always thought I was just being a baby. The phone thing was the first time I really expressed concern openly and consistently to him and out of frustration with his non-compliance I turned to Reddit.\n\nSo a lot has happened since my original post and I wanted to make an update. After making the post and a few hours of reading the replies I told myself I HAD to know what was on those flash drives. My boyfriend and I had plans to meet up with his friend at a diner for some lunch the following day. So I made a plan.\n\nBefore lunch, while at BFs house, I would grab all four flash drives when he wasn't in the room. I would go about the day normally but I would check them when I got home, all four, every single file I found. I made a few plans ahead of time that covered every senario I could think of.\n\nIf I found regular ol' porn on them I would return them the next day and apologize for invading his privacy but make it abundantly clear as to why I did it in the first place. If I found weird fetish porn I would do the same thing but express that I want him to be more transparent with me over his sexual preferences, I would not agree to do anything I'm not completely comfortable with. If I found videos of his ex, I would message her and ask is she was aware he had the videos and if she was ok with him still having them. Then I would confont my boyfriend and tell him I wasn't comfortable with him still have videos of ex while we were dating. If I found videos of myself I would save them to my computer and delete them off of the drives. I would ask him about it before and after telling him that I took the drives and depending on how that conversation goes I may look into taking legal action. I really didn't want to, I don't know shit about how that works and I'm already buried is student loans as is. I figured I would only do it if I found out he posted the videos online or something. But anyway, that was my plan. It was the best I could do. I'm a very shy person and a total pushover so I absolutely had to plan this out in advance and force myself to comply with what I needed to do.\n\nSo, at his house I swiped the drives while he was out of the room and stashed them in my bag. The day went on like normal until I had a certain conversation with my boyfriend's friend who we'll call Jon. Jon and I were having some small talk while my boyfriend was in the bathroom. The conversation of our sex life came up. Now, for a bit of context. This friend likes to give my boyfriend little \"challenges\" to do whilst we are intimate. Usually innocent things like shouting out certain movie quotes or doing something to embarrass himself. I think it's kinda weird but it doesn't really bother me as long as it doesn't become anything more I'm ok with it. Anyway, Jon decided to give me a little challenge, he told me to shout \"The British are coming! The British are coming!\" (My boyfriend is British but born and raised in America) I thought it was kinda silly and clever but he mentioned that I should record it. I kinda paused and I think he realized this made me freeze up so he assured me he wasn't asking to watch or anything. I asked him why he even suggested that in the first place and THIS DUDE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT WE LIKED TO RECORD OURSELVES. At least that's what my boyfriend told him. I almost burst into tears. I asked him everything that he knew and he told me that he thought we liked to record ourselves and that I was just shy a about it. Because that's what my boyfriend told him. Jon assured me that he was never shown any videos or anything. But the conversation ended there because my boyfriend came back. I asked Jon not to say anything yet and I wanted to get through lunch but I felt physically sick and excused myself from the table and went straight home assuring BF I was ok but that my food tasted funny and I was going to go home.\n\nI watched all the drives. There was a fair number of videos in each. 10-20 per drive. I didn't watch the full videos, I just skipped around in them looking for signs of myself. The drives were actually category's and I don't think I can say names without breaking some kind of rule but just picture three basic search terms on any porn site. I saw no videos of myself. However, one drive, had videos of him and his ex. I recognized his bed, and it was definitely her. I had to skip around a lot because I was trying not to look at her body, just get a good view of her face. After I confirmed I was definitely not on the drives and that she definitely was. I messaged her over Facebook and told her about the situation. I apologized for watching them and asked if she knew about them. She seemed a bit surprised but assured me she did know he had them at some point and didn't really care is he still did or not. But she understood why I wouldn't want him to have them and got pretty pissed off when I told her about him possibly recording me. She told me to record him when I confront him about it.\n\nAt this point I was kinda lost. I didn't have solid proof that he did record me but after hearing about it from his friend and seeing videos oh him and his ex, I was very shaken up. I slept on it, well tried to sleep anyway. Then first thing in the morning, I went straight to his house and demanded to see his phone. I never ask to look though his phone ever. I think it's a total invasion of privacy and would never ask under any other circumstance. He kept refusing but I threatened to break up with him then and there if he didn't. He quickly handed it over. I looked through photos, apps, messages. Nothing. A few pictures of himself in his photos but none of me, let alone videos. I asked him is he has ever recorded me. He said no, I screamed at him and pounded his chest calling him a liar. He tried to calm me down and pulled me into the house. This all happened on his front porch and I was definitely making a scene. After getting inside and closing the door he asked why I was acting this way all of a sudden. I told him I know he's been recoding me and to just admit it because I've already asked his friends about it. A bit of a bluff, I only talked to the one friend. I pleaded for him just to tell me because it scared the shit out of me. I want to know what he did with those videos. I wanted to know if he shared it with someone, I wanted to know if he put it online. I begged for my own fucking sanity for him to tell me so I don't go the rest of my life terrified that one day someone will link me a video of myself on a porn site or something. He broke down and admitted that he had recorded me. Started crying and explained his ex was really into recording them and got him into it. He swore that he never saved the videos and immediately deleted them after we were done and never shared the videos with anyone because they never even stayed on his phone. Apparently he liked the process of recording the video. He didn't do it with the intent to watch them later. Because he knew I didn't want to do it. He thought if he deleted them immediately and I didn't know it wouldn't hurt.\n\nI don't know if what he said was true or not, I didn't find videos of myself on the drives. And I looked through his phone before he had a chance to delete anything. But even if he was being 100% honest with me then, I didn't care. He lied to my face constantly, abused any trust I gave him and put his own sexual desires above my safety and care. I have never felt so violated in my life. Fuck this guy. I'm not proud of how I acted. I am by no means intimidating and powerful. I'm 4'10 and 105 lbs. But I ugly cried, screamed in his face and swung at him a bunch until he had to physically restrain me before I broke something. I just lost it, I swear I don't have anger issues but I was in such a state of mental anguish I couldn't control myself. I left shortly after that and you better believe I broke up with him.\n\nSo that's where I am now. I called off work for the next 3 days, skiped class this morning, and I've been burying myself in Netflix until I can bring myself to even think about what to do next. I don't think I'm going to pursue legal action. I don't have and proof of what he did, only a statement from one person. Part of me really wishes I did record the conversation like the girl suggested. However, I live in a two party consent state so I would have had to tell him immediately after confronting him that I was recording him. He may not have confessed then. I just feel tired now. Like I don't even have the energy to be upset. The sadness from the breakup is creeping in. I really thought I loved this guy. But I'm refusing to let myself get upset over him like this. So for now I'm going to get better aquatinted with stranger things.\n\nThank you all for the advice on my first post, I don't think I would have taken action without you guys.

She said she would be home late and not to worry, after 11pm she said she was going to stay at her friends house and go to work from there in the morning. This is very unusual so I started calling and messaging like crazy hoping that she could just take a taxi back. She refused to pick up the phone and told me not to worry. \n\nShe continued to refuse and was obviously v drunk so I became worried and very suspicious. Not proud of it but I went into her emails and checked the rota for her volunteer work and sure enough she wasn't on it. This led me to check her Internet history and I found a whole heap of searches clearly indicating an affair.\n\nI went to work that morning and she still wasn't back so I confronted her when I got home that evening. She admitted the searches and said they were just her fantasies and that she had been at an 80s night and nothing had happened. When I told her she hadn't stayed with at her friends she admitted that too but said she had been at the club all night and came straight home. Obvious lies as she was looking at hotels online and from card payments from our joint account I can see was not in a place that does 80s nights.\n\nSo I'm not an idiot and it's 100% clear what has happened but she will not admit it and becomes really angry with me when I bring it up. She says constantly that she stayed out and made the searches because I have never paid her enough attention and she needed more intimacy from me. \n\nI'm losing my mind because I still want to fix this but can't even proceed to the first step of accepting the situation (let alone forgiving her) as she wont admit what is obvious. Shes so angry with me and has recently told me she is scared of me now because I was so angry the evening after she was out all night. She doesn't look remotely sorry for how she has acted and now when I bring up the night she simply says I told you everything I'm not gonna talk about it.

Finally. \n\nObligatory apology for the huge wall of text.\n\nFirst of all, I just want to give a HUGE thank you to everyone who responded. I\u2019m working my way through the posts now, and besides a few, everyone was incredibly supportive. I\u2019ll try to reply to people but I think the post got locked (?) and there was an overwhelming number of responses and DMs. There were several ladies in particular who reminded me of my worth and told me that they\u2019d been where I was, and I can\u2019t tell you all how much I appreciate you. So many comments made me cry because they made me realize how miserable I was and how badly I was being treated. So a huge thank you to ALL of you. That post and the response it got was the motivation I needed.\n\nI broke up with him. I decided it after seeing all the responses and knowing that I was justified in wanting to break up with him. Besides what I described in my OP, we had many, many problems. I could write a whole list of things much worse than that post that I absolutely should\u2019ve broken up with him for. I\u2019d tried to break up with him several times before but he always ended up roping me back in. \n\nI acted like everything was normal because I had a lot of stuff at his house and wanted to make sure I could get it (in the past when I\u2019d tried to end it he would prevent me from leaving/taking my stuff). The night after my post, I had a really tough time getting to sleep because I knew what I had to do the next day. I think I ended up getting to sleep at 5 or 6, waking up at 10 to go to work, and working a 12 hour shift exhausted, nervous, and with a stomach ache and sore legs (unrelated lol). The whole time, though, I kept my resolve and knew what I was going to do. I kept acting like everything was normal until I got to his house. I originally wasn\u2019t going to tell anybody I was going to break up with him, but my family knows my struggles that I\u2019ve had with it before so I knew they\u2019d want to know. My brother works with me, so I told him what was going down and gave him Tim\u2019s address, god forbid I needed help. He told my mom so she knew. I didn\u2019t expect him to, but he said he\u2019d stay in the area just in case. So he followed me to Tim\u2019s house and parked out of sight.\n\nWhen I got there, I got to his room and told him straight away that I was breaking up with him. He didn\u2019t believe me at first, but as soon as he realized I was serious, he started pleading. He said he knew he was wrong, that he knew he had overreacted and felt bad about it, that he had a nice night planned for us and it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t believe it, but I just knew he would eventually fall back into his cycle of behavior if I stayed with him. He never claimed that I was in the wrong; instead he suddenly recognized that everything he\u2019d been doing was wrong. I listened to him when I had to, but mostly I packed my things into garbage bags. He got in my way several times and wouldn\u2019t let me past. He also dumped out my bags twice. But I told him that if he wasn\u2019t going to let me leave (which he\u2019d done before), there would be a problem \u2014 I\u2019d yell and get his roommates involved. He kept going on about how I was the best thing that had ever happened to him, that if he knew how miserable I was that he would have changed, that we just needed to sit and talk, that I needed to get angry at him to give him a wake up call and that basically it didn\u2019t need to get to this. I did not humor him. I kept packing and told him that I\u2019m sorry but that it was over. I reminded him that if he cared so much about me that he would\u2019ve changed a long time ago; that I shouldn\u2019t have needed to be the one to tell him how bad it had gotten. He kept trying to hug me and I kept telling him not to touch me. At one point, he was saying that I was all he had and that he didn\u2019t know how he was going to get on without me. He took his PS4 controller and wrapped the cord around his neck by his headboard. I tried to pull it off him and he said not to fucking touch him, so I kept packing. He stopped almost immediately though, and said that he didn\u2019t really want to kill himself and that what he did was an immature stunt. I said it was abusive. He agreed. \n\nI finally got all my stuff together and was standing by his bedroom door to leave, but he was in my way. He asked (not for the first time that night) if this was final; was there really no chance? I said no. He asked for one last kiss. I said I didn\u2019t think that would be healthy.\n\n(I know I messed up here, and I\u2019m sorry, but I said if he *really* wanted, that I would meet him in a week in a public place for closure. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst idea because I absolutely have no intention of getting back together. I also left a few pretty important things at his house that I really want back. I probably won\u2019t meet up with him, but I don\u2019t know how else to get my stuff back without asking his roommates to go into his room and get it).\n\nI told him that if he really loved and respected me, that he\u2019d let me leave now. He finally let me past and followed me to my car. I think he asked again if this was the end. I said yes. He said he didn\u2019t want to be manipulative, but that he didn\u2019t know if he could get on without me. I think I said that he could and he would. I was willing to hug him, so I asked if he wanted one, but he was already walking away. I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tim\u201d (I know, I know), got in my car and left. My brother followed me home, and now I\u2019m at home. I played with my niece and I\u2019ve been hanging out with my mom ever since. \n\nTim\u2019s texted me quite a bit since, but I put him on do not disturb. He said some alarming things that hint toward killing himself (\u201cgoodbye forever\u201d), which very much bothers me. That\u2019s a lot to have on my conscience. I know I need to block him altogether, but on the chance that he did something, I don\u2019t think that I could ever forgive myself. I\u2019m considering contacting his friends, letting them know what\u2019s going on and to maybe keep an eye out for them so I don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s being too involved or not but I think it would ease my conscience. \n\nAgain, I want to thank you all so incredibly much for helping me realize what I deserve. I finally stuck to my guns and took the first step in making myself happy again. I should probably go to sleep soon but I\u2019ll try to respond to whoever I can. Thank you guys.

He is attentive, sweet, caring. Everything I've wanted in an adult relationship. We got sober together, we're building our credit after some rough times to try and buy a house, we're getting in shape as a team, and I really believe I will marry him someday. \n\nMy family is from rural northeastern Pennsylvania. We've been operation a farm for over 100 years. I wouldn't call them rednecks because they all have immaculate homes with tacky decorations (think \"live laugh love\" but a *smidge* nicer/classier), but they're all tight-laced conservatives. When I was young I recognized I didn't follow their hive mind, so I moved far for college as soon as I could. I haven't lived in PA for ten years now. Out of my 20 family members consisting of aunts, uncles, cousins, parents, grandparents and siblings, I'm the only one who doesn't live on the farm or in PA. \n\nRecently I brought my boyfriend to visit for a week. I asked my mother what she thought of BF, and she looked away, shrugged and said \"he's fine\". So of course I press her. She tells me he's a dork, and that he's immature, and most of all he's \"teensy\". \n\nTo be fair, he is 5'5\" and weighs in at around 130lbs. He is small. He's been small forever. But I'm only 5'4\" and 140lbs, so I think it bugs her that we're almost the same size. In her eyes the man should be large and looming, not short and petite, regardless of how well he treats you. I can also admit that he's immature at times, and while I don't always love that quality he does help me loosen up a bit and relax (I have had severe anxiety/depression in the past). So even that isn't a total negative in my book. \n\nThe thing that gets me is that my aunts have apparently commented on his size, and even my cousin asked \"what's wrong with his voice??\" because it's not super low. But it's not like he's squeaky by any means. He also got docked points in their collective book because he refuses to change his tone when speaking to kids, coming off as \"annoyed\" to them. The kids in question are 13-17?? Does he really need to baby talk teenagers?? \n\nI can't talk to any of my family members about this, because it's literally me against 19 others. He's been attentive, polite, thanking everyone for their hospitality, bought dinner for our immediate family of 6 the other night, helped my mom do dishes and clean after meals. What the fuck else do they need? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. \n\nMy mom, to top it all off, dropped \"I just don't want you to settle\" on me today while BF was in the bathroom. I was floored. How do I approach this? I can't disown my family over it, but I certainly won't break up with the love of my life because they're judgemental. I just don't want this to be a constant argument forever. \n\nTl;Dr: family dislikes BF for being \"dorky\", claims I'm settling.

We first expanded our family with our beautiful cat, and then with our Goofball of a dog. \n\nWe went from apartment to apartment to our current home that I purchased. I have been working 5-6 days a week every week since we got together, where she has been job to job and back to school constantly up until about 8 months ago where she has not worked since.

A big part of it was that she was in and out of hospital at the time and I didn't want to burden her with what I said.\n\nAnother part of it was that she never talked to me about her emotions and whenever I talked to her about my emotions I'd get a motivational speech but never really had a conversation about why I felt how I felt or whatever, I still find it really hard to have those conversations now and it stresses me out and really affects my life. At some point in the conversation, we were talking about the fact that around that age I was in a horrible relationship and I didn't really feel comfortable going to her because of her anger.\n\nEverything else in the conversation had been completely fine but when I hit her with that it was like she had enough and she started talking about how I had to: \"Take responsibility for the decisions I had made at that age and the person I was\", she talked about me being super touchy at that age and that she was afraid of talking to me at that age because she felt she had to walk on eggshells. I completely agree that I was often not really fun at that age, I was the worst kind of teenager and would be really touchy about interests and politics and I wasn't great to talk about.\n\nBut I also thought that it was unfair to expect me to talk to someone freely about my emotions who \"randomly hit me\". When I said that she flipped out and started getting annoyed and said she'd only \"Hit me once, in the kitchen\" but here's the thing, she didn't do that at all! To my recollection, she started hitting me around the time she got sick, when I was about 14 and it continued getting more and more frequent until I was 17. At around 17 it was something like twice every two months and that led to us having a really big conversation and her not ever doing it again. But it was definitely an escalating thing as I remember dealing with it at separate ages and being really scared at separate ages.\n\nAfter that, the conversation kept escalating and I hung up in anger.\n\nI feel really confused and hurt that she'd say that about me, and I don't want to not talk to her about something I feel I've gotten over. But, I also feel really weird that she's either lying or doesn't remember something that informed my whole adolescence.

She got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. She's handling it like a champ. We've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person I know. Always keeps her head up even after this. And I love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. But everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. Recently I had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. Honestly I didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all I cared for was my girlfriend. But we kept talking and I ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where I realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. One thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if I was my gf's caregiver. She has help that comes a few times a week, but I help her out whenever I can, though she doesn't always want me to. And if we stay together that's never going to change. I know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. There's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. I am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, I just don't really know what to write. I love her to the moon and back. But then I think, what kind of boyfriend am I if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. We were planning to get engaged next year. She's always so happy to see me and knows I've had issues dealing with the accident. She's so selfless it's not even funny. Sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested I get a FWB so I don't get frustrated.

In her text, she referred to my son as \"boyfriend\". \n\nThis isn't the first time she has done this, and she used to call my husband \"boyfriend\" when he was little, so on their side of the family, for whatever reason, it's considered normal and cute. \n\nI have always been uncomfortable with this nickname. In my opinion, it's highly inappropriate and extremely creepy, even though I know they don't mean it that way. (I don't know if this affects my opinion on the nickname, but, full disclosure, I was molested as a child and raped by a pedophile at 13). \n\nAnyways, back to the texts. I typed out my response to the main part of her text (along the lines of \"Oh, no, actually we are going to blah blah blah.\") At the end of the text, I started a new paragraph and just said \"Please don't call him \"boyfriend\", I don't like it.\"\n\nNo response from her, but about 10mins later my MIL is blowing up my phone. She starts the conversation by making an excuse about how she knows about my conversation with GMIL by saying that her phone is glitching, so she received GMILs texts to me and my texts to GMIL, then says \"And I am NOT happy with how you are talking to GMIL.\" \n\nI'm just like wtf? First of all, I know you're lying. I know GMIL just sent you the texts. Im not dumb. That's not how phones work. \n\nSo I said \"What are you talking about? Because I asked her to stop calling him boyfriend?\"\n\nAnd she went on to say that it was really rude of me to say and how I said it came off as mean because it was at the end of the text (???) And that I need to text GMIL and say something nice because she's upset and let her call my son whatever she wants because she's old and it makes her feel like she's unloved and walking on eggshells because I want her to not call my son that.\n\nI gave up and showed my husband the texts and asked him if I should even respond. I felt like nothing I say would get through to either of them. He said no, don't text them back, but I'm going to call my mom.\n\nThe call to his mom went horribly. \"Well, *your wife* was being rude blah blah blah\" \"We have the right to call him whatever we want because we are his grandparents and he is *our baby*, he's *my baby*.\" My husband flipped his shit when she said this and said something that made her mad (I don't remember) and she told him to go fuck himself.\n\nLater, he gets a call from his sister wondering why their mom just called her, crying, and saying that her and GMIL are not talking to us until we apologize. They talked for hours and my husband (thank God) defended me the whole time. \n\nI don't want to apologize for what I said/asked. I feel like I did nothing wrong. But now MIL and GMIL are refusing to contact us until we apologize first (they never apologize first if anything ever happens). \n\nMy husband regrets what he said to his mom to piss her off, but doesn't think he should be the one to call and apologize to them (he thinks they should).\n\nWhat do we do? MIL was supposed to go with me to a doctor's appointment this week, but now we are on no speaking terms. Wtf do we do?

Before I delve in, I will answer that. I love this man. I love him so much. He's my best friend and I firmly believe we were meant to find each other. I love him, flaws and all, but it comes to a point where I physically cannot stand dealing with this anymore. \n\nMy fiance got married pretty young to a woman that I would describe as a narcissist. A month after they got married, she was pregnant. And then he had another kid with her. Their marriage was pretty crappy during that time but it was after that where it all hit the fan. He was abused, and I feel bad for him for that and have sympathy for him, but I just can't stand by and watch this anymore. \n\nHis kids are teenagers now and he has to constantly fight with his ex-wife to see them. Why? Because neither of them bothered to go to court and get a custody order. I, quite frankly, think this is ridiculous and if I separated from my abusive ex, court would be the first thing on my mind. His excuse was he was young and dumb.\n\nMy point now is that you are not young and dumb anymore! For 2 years, its almost every single day that they are on the phone fighting with each other. She will say he can see them one day and then the next day she says he can't. I've told him numerous times he needs to get a custody order. He says he will but then never does. \n\nAs much as I love him and want to marry him, I'm at my wits end and told him today that he needs to cut contact with his ex wife, go to court, and get it settled or I'm not going to stand by and watch him let himself be abused. He's allowing it to happen by not being proactive. \n\nIt hurts because I know I'm hurting him by threatening to leave him but I honestly will if he doesn't get it together. Its disrespectful to myself to watch my fiance argue with his ex wife every single day about seeing his kids when it absolutely does not have to be like that.\n\nOkay. Vent over.

There was 9-15 people there, not a crazy party or anything. We didnt even have a lot of alcohol. \n\nSo our roommate invited a friend who brought his girlfriend, we'll call them G and S. First time for me and my boyfriend to meet either of them. They're totally cool the entire party, it all was great. They were about to leave so my boyfriend wanted to be a good party host and walk them out. There was an awkward exchange between S and my boyfriend as he walked past her. She was seemingly going in for a hug even though he was walking past. She follows him to the front door, hugs him and then kisses his neck and pulls him closer to her. He backs up and just shakes his head and she said sorry. I didnt see any of this as I was in the living room with the other guests. But he came back into the room and was obviously uncomfortable. He told me right away. \n\nI want to message her on facebook, not to blame her or to cause problems. I just want it to be clear that that behavior is NOT okay. And I want to know WHY she thought it was okay. My boyfriend made absolutely no advances towards her and neither did she the entire party. It was very clear that him and I were together, as clear as it was that she had a boyfriend as well!! I didnt message her after the party as everyone was not sober. So I plan on messaging her this morning. \n\nI'm a very spiteful person, and I dont think I can write this message without showing my anger towards this girl.

We had a daughter. Our relationship had gotten really toxic and I had always wondered if I was gay. I had met my current husband towards the end of my first marriage and we quickly became best friends. Going to the gym, taking my daughter to the zoo together, playing video games. He was my first male sexual experience in every sense of the statement and he loved my daughter. We moved quickly because he was kicked out for being gay and had to move in with me but I was OK with it because I truly believe this was the first time I had loved someone (aside from my daughter) completely and totally unconditionally.\n\nSo we dated for three years and had one rough patch where I broke up with him for a couple of months because I felt like I had been in relationships since I was 12 and I needed to learn how to be on my own, I hurt him pretty bad but he stood by my side and I quickly realized how empty my life felt without him and we got back together and bought a house together. \n\nSo we\u2019ve lived this (aside from typical bickering) a somewhat perfect life. We go on dates. Travel from time to time. Have amazing, supportive friends and family. Great sex. So the months leading up to our wedding he felt extremely distant and I found myself making statements to him questioning whether he really loves me or not. I just wanted more affection or to feel like he wasn\u2019t pulling away. The wedding came and went and we both agreed it was the perfect day. He exchanged vows to me and to our daughter and put a necklace around her neck and told her that she now had two daddies that would both love her forever. He also told me in his vows that he would never give up on us. I thought things would start to get better because the stress of the wedding, having family and friends from out state living with us due to the wedding and just all of that stress was going to dissipate and we could work on having more good times again. I had been asking him to talk to me about what\u2019s been bothering him and I was constantly told \u201cwhen our friends leave we will talk, I don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable.\u201d I had noticed he had been giving everyone more attention than me but figured it was because they don\u2019t live here and he was trying to enjoy the little time he had with them. On the car ride home it felt like he had checked out completely. No real reason, just wasn\u2019t into this brand new marriage anymore. It seriously caught me off guard because our friends and family constantly for years tell me how obsessed with me he is. Anytime we drink he forces everyone around us to tell me how cute I am or compliment me. \u201cIsn\u2019t he so cute?\u201d And if they didn\u2019t comment he would say \u201ctell him how cute he is. He really is.\u201d It was actually kind of cute. He would show off pictures of me and my weight loss journey or my body and how good I\u2019m coming along in the gym or brag about my accomplishments. He was seriously just as infatuated with me for the last 3 years as he was when we first met. So all of this feels completely out of character for him. \n\nHe told me he needed space which completely freaked me out and I did panic and suffocate him a little. He went camping for 2-3 days and stayed at his parents and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. He tried to end our marriage through text message stating that I deserved someone who loved me and he would never be enough for me. I begged and was a doormat for weeks. I bought stuff to make s\u2019mores, new outfits that I thought he would like to see me in, 24 packs of beer to drink together under the stars and talk about how to fix our marriage- which he took the beer to his parents and drink it all by himself. I\u2019ve been completely walked on. Finally when he met me face to face on a park bench (he wanted somewhere public I\u2019m not sure if he thought I would make a scene or try to have sex with him? It\u2019s like he flipped and isn\u2019t the person I married) - so on the park bench I had written out pages of things I was going to change. I would not nitpick at him, I would let him have space when we\u2019re arguing and leave because I understand that\u2019s how he copes, I would go on a date with him every week until we get the love back that he feels is missing, we would go to counseling. I read this long letter begging for him to fight for our family and our marriage and he listened and without shedding a tear or even acting sad he said \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what you want to hear.\u201d And left. He\u2019s since gotten his things and moved out and I live in the home we bought together with my daughter. I\u2019ve been going to counseling, got my doctor to start me on depression medicine. It gets easier everyday but I still feel this sadness and it\u2019s perpetuated by the fact that I still don\u2019t understand what happened or what changed. Why did he marry me a week before? Why did he write all of those vows if he felt this way? And to a five year old girl? I keep asking him if there\u2019s hope and all he will say is \u201cif it\u2019s meant to be it\u2019ll be but you have to move on\u201d. I\u2019m not ready to get a divorce. A second divorce. I told him if we got married it was forever and he said he agreed and kept asking me to propose. I\u2019m not ready to give up on this but he refuses to fight for us. I\u2019ve called him crying, asking to talk for weeks but he is completely cold to me. I am giving him space now and haven\u2019t texted or called him in several days. I told him if he still felt this way in 6 months I would sign the divorce papers but I\u2019m not ready to give up yet. What do I do in the meantime? I\u2019ve been focusing on bettering myself and my daughter but I feel trapped in this limbo of sadness. I\u2019m consumed by this. A lot of our family and friends are upset with him because they see me crying all the time and he\u2019s not even upset about not seeing me or our daughter. He\u2019s pissed about the \u201cdrama I\u2019ve caused him\u201d. I really don\u2019t recognize him anymore and even if he did decide to be with me again I\u2019m not sure how we could get past this. I feel like maybe he was really unhappy and decided he had to completely reinvent himself which means losing me too. He\u2019s talked about quitting his job as a cop and going and working at a brewery. Moving to Michigan. It\u2019s like he was unhappy with every thing and needed to just run away. We could\u2019ve made changes together. I would\u2019ve moved with him or supported a career change. There isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t have worked through for our marriage. My therapist says I\u2019m taking all of the blame but there\u2019s no blame only responsibility and we\u2019re both equal responsible for our choices. I get that. But I just don\u2019t know where to go from here. \n\nWait for him and continue to fight for a marriage that my partner seems completely uninterested in or give up on my marriage after only a few weeks? \ud83d\ude1e", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2127797, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (26M) husband wants to divorce me (28M) one week after marrying me because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t love me anymore\u201d.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572144692, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dk4zhw/my_26m_husband_wants_to_divorce_me_28m_one_week/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "E2410cuber", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_tkoka", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571497604, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dk4xw2/my_crush_18f_invited_me_18m_to_go_to_the_movies/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk4xw2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 137, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dk4xw2/my_crush_18f_invited_me_18m_to_go_to_the_movies/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571497605, "score": 1061, "selftext": "So, I have a crush on this girl I go to school with.

But the other side of me immediately went into over analyzing. \n\nWe spent the next 2 weekends hanging out non stop. Honestly, it was perfect. He was literally everything I want in a person. But I couldn\u2019t shake how fast things were moving. He was saying I love you flat out at that point. Talking about me moving in and buying a ring. I want nothing more than to find my person and be in love, but there\u2019s no way that can be real, right? I ended up having a freak out and told him that I had only ever been told that by 2 other people in my adult life; my ex husband and a guy I dated for 2 months. I was with my ex my husband for nearly 5 years. I ended it after nearly 2 years of marriage because I felt we had grown apart. It also didn\u2019t help that he was a narcissistic asshole and slept with an 18 year old when we were on a break. The 2-month guy really crushed me. He said I love you after a month. As it turns out he only said it to manipulate me into basically being his piggy bank. I wanted so much to believe that someone loved me that I let myself be fooled. \n\nI told him that as a result of those 2 painful breakups I have a hard time trusting. The last thing I want is to say I love you to someone that doesn\u2019t really mean it. It\u2019s not just a pretty thing to say. Those words have weight. I asked him if we could just move a little slower. He said he agreed. That night we got drunk and he told me he loved me again. I didn\u2019t say anything but we kept seeing each other like everything was fine. \n\nUltimately after another awkward drunken conversation about my fears and trust he did a complete 180 and started acting like he didn\u2019t care if we saw each other again.

After that he said we should keep things light and fun while we build trust. 2 days later he broke up with me. \n\nI\u2019m sad, hurt, and angry. I feel like I fucked this up somehow.

My boyfriend has been chubby since we got together, but he has always hated his body because he used to be very fit and classically attractive as a teen and early 20s. He would always talk about how he used to get so much attention from girls.\n\nI never minded him being chubby, he had lost about 2 stone (28lb) before we got together (1.5 years ago) and stayed that same weight. He was 5'11 and about 220lbs before starting the diet.\n\n8 weeks ago he announced that he was \"finally going to take weight loss seriously\" and start a water fast. (This is where you don't eat or consume any calories, just water) I was worried at first, but he reassured me he was only going to do it for one week to \"cleanse\" his body, then he was going to start a healthy diet.\n\nBut, no. He did the fast for one week, lost 10 pounds and was extremely happy, so he decided to continue and do it for an entire month. I didn't want him to do that, but there was nothing I could do to stop him. So he water fasts for a whole month and loses 30lbs. \n\nDuring this time our relationship starts to go downhill. he started getting irritated with me easily and spent all his time exercising. Obviously exercising + starving yourself is not a good combination so he was tired for most of the day and even passed out at the gym. We stopped doing activities together. He got very annoyed with me when I suggested stopping and thought i wanted him to fail.\n\nHe weighed about 190 after the month long water fast which wasn't good enough, so he decided to do it for another month to get down to his final weight. I get very upset at him and tell him that it's dangerous. He says he will go to a doctor to get a check up and ask if it's safe. I say I'm coming with him, but he doesn't want me to. Btw- he does supplement vitamins and minerals, but there is obviously some danger doing this for so long. \n\nHe \"goes to the doctor\" and apparently they tell him that he is in great health and water fasting for another month is fine. I don't believe he even went, but he got angry when I accused him of lying. \n\nIt's like he has completely lost his old personality. He used to be funny and sweet and cuddly, now he flinches when i touch him. He gets annoyed at the slightest thing. He doesn't go out anymore. \n\nIt's been 7 weeks now and I'm so worried about him. I think it's getting to the point where he's going to hurt himself. He is a \"healthy weight\" now but doesn't want to stop until he reaches his goal. \n\nI don't understand why he's playing with his health like this. His hair is falling out, but he's trying to hide it from me. He has no energy, sometimes he has to take caffeine pills just to get out of bed. \nHe is obsessed with losing body fat and thinks he still has a fat stomach even though he definitely doesn't. \n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n----\n\nTldr; boyfriend is starving himself (water fasting) to lose weight and I'm worried about him.

By everything, I mean EVERYTHING. She thinks I don't know that but I can clearly tell because some of the things are moved around and not where they used to be. One day she went through a box where I keep all of my medical things such as all of my medicine, things I take with me to chemotherapy, documents, painkillers and most importantly: my injections that help me stay ALIVE. I absolutely hate taking them as they are painful and leave me with sore muscles after but I'm willing to take them if they keep me going. They are very small syringes pre-filled with the fluid I need to inject. I also have a pack of needles which I attach to the syringe whenever I take the medicine. All of those things were in a separate bag so they were kept clean and sterile. The worst thing is that the NHS does not pay for them which I find strange. They are relatively cheap compared to some others as they are only \u00a312 for a set of 6 (3 days). Anyways, one day my mum goes through my things and tells me she needs to talk to me. She starts yelling at me asking what the syringes and needles are for although she knows very well what they are for. This is the conversation we had (as much as I remember)\n\nMum: What are these? Are you doing drugs?\n\nMe: You know what they are for. Please put them back in the bag they need to be clean.\n\nMum: I'm not putting them back I will throw them away if you don't confess you're doing heroin. \n\nMe: I don't do heroin and you know that. I need those so I can stay alive please put them back. \n\nThen she proceeded to open all of the syringes and needles and touch them all over so they were pretty much useless at that point. That was more than \u00a3100 of my supplies wasted and I was left with no medicine. I can't order more because she opens all of my mail and she will just take them away again. I'm now forced to take a train to the hospital every single day to get the injection there which costs extra \u00a310 because of the train ticket. Is there anything I can do in order to stop my mum opening my mail or is there any legal issues there. Can I go to the police about this?\n\nTd;lr: I use medicine in a form of injections.

We joined a local raiding group about a year ago. We\u2019ve made a lot of friends through this group, and one friend my husband made is M (25m).\n\nM is FtM transgender and has a history of severe mental health issues, so in the beginning I did my absolute best to get along with him, even helping him out with rides to raids and making him food (he lives alone).\n\nOver the last few months, M had started to rub me the wrong way. He can have a completely normal conversation with S, but as soon as anyone else is there, he becomes snappy and rude. He\u2019s told others in the group multiple times that they\u2019re \u201cstealing (S) away from him\u201d (including me) and he flirts with S by saying some pretty gross things in front of me. If anyone tries to combat M on anything, he just starts saying stuff like \u201cWell I\u2019ll just go home and cry, obviously no one wants me here\u201d or uses his mental health as an excuse (seriously, some of the stuff he says or threatens to go do is disturbing enough that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to write them). I\u2019ve talked to S about this and asked him to confront M about being rude to people and disrespectful of me, but he\u2019s not the confrontational type. He just kinda goes along with what M says like it\u2019s all really funny. When asked, S always says M is one of the most lovely guys, he\u2019s just misunderstood.\n\nSo instead of dealing with M, I started just not going out when I know he\u2019s going to be there. Today my husband invited me to a raid, that a bunch of our friends are coming to, and I said no because I hate being around M. I\u2019d never tell my husband who he can and can\u2019t hang out with, but I\u2019m not willingly subjecting myself to rude comments that I 100% know are coming.\n\nS then got really upset about how I never come out anymore, but when I explained why, he just sighed and said nothing.

I don't know where to go to post this. I am balling my eyes out sitting outside my hotel while I'm typing this. \n\nA little background: My sister has been openly dating girls and my parents are aware, but my mom is in complete denial that she is gay. My mom is extremely strict and religious, but she's been fine with the fact that my sister has her girlfriend over all the time and my sister even refers to her as her \"girlfriend\" to my parents. My mom even loves my sister's girlfriend. However, when it comes to me and my boyfriend, she REFUSES to accept our relationship. She will let my sister sleep over at her girlfriends house, but damn me to hell if I even TRY to sleep at my boyfriend's. She accepted my sister's girlfriend so well, yet she was so cold to meet my current boyfriend. She will let my sister's girlfriend into her room, but my boyfriend can't step foot into mine. We have fought COUNTLESS times over the fact that she treats me so different when it comes to me and my sister, but she doesn't see it- nor does she accept it. She is the type of mom who believes she is always right because she is the parent. No one in my family has my back, and I don't understand it. My dad is the type to just go along with my mom because he is afraid of making her mad. Just a couple weeks ago, we had a huge argument, I was trying to explain to my mom that she treats my sister so different than me (for the 10000 time), my sister overheard her name from the other room, thought I was talking shit, and came in and started to scream at me, almost ready to swing (she has before so I was prepared for it). \n\nLast year, my sister moved to LA for school, and her girlfriend visited her EVERY weekend and my parents were well aware. They were completely okay with it. About a month and a half ago, I moved in with her to go to school there as well. And they gave us one rule: No boys (they are paying for our apartment and schooling). Obviously I did not follow this rule, and my sister was cool with my boyfriend visiting on the weekends. For one of my projects, I had to make a video and my boyfriend was in it and helped me with it.\n\nFast forward to today: I am in Hawaii and my birthday is tomorrow. Me, my mom, my dad, and my sister are in the hotel room sitting around talking. She was talking about how proud she was of us and wanted to see some video we took today at a botanical garden we went to earlier (we are film majors). Well, me being so fucking stupid and just wanting my mother to be proud and happy for me for ONE time in my life, I showed her the video that my boyfriend helped me with. About 10 seconds in, she saw him and completely shut down. I went straight to the bathroom and started to cry. The last time I fought about this with my mom it almost tore my family apart, so I just kept my mouth closed and cried to myself. She yelled at me through the door saying how disrespectful it was for me not to even ask if my boyfriend could come visit. She was so mad that my boyfriend came, and I knew that if I were to even ask she would immediately say no. So after I heard the front door of the hotel room slam, I went out, packed my things, and now I am outside typing this crying my eyes out while my parents try to find me. I straight up asked my mom why she lets my sister and her girlfriend sleep in the same bed and why it is different for me and her response was, \"I don't want to argue\". \n\nI am so done. I don't know what to do. I don't have any money, my own sister doesn't even have my back, and she is my best friend. But I am so angry at her and my mom for not seeing my side. I am so sad.

For example, last night, while at my boyfriend\u2019s house, I had said early in the day that I was probably going to get some ice cream later. I thought I\u2019d mentioned that I didn\u2019t really want ice cream but rather something fruity, like Italian ice. I guess I didn\u2019t. While at the store I also got a bunch of juice for me to have at my boyfriend\u2019s house. He usually has a problem with me bringing home sugary things because he has impulse problems, so I usually don\u2019t. But I knew he didn\u2019t really like juice so I\u2019d be okay. I also got him a case of red bull (I don\u2019t drink it), but I forgot to get sugar free stuff. When I got back, he was pretty pissed because 1. I didn\u2019t get ice cream when that\u2019s what I went out for. 2. I got juice and he will drink it (didn\u2019t think he liked it) and 3. I didn\u2019t get the sugar free red bull. I\u2019ll admit that I have problems when shopping and buy too much. And when he gets red bull, he gets sugar free, so I should\u2019ve known that, but it was an impulse buy and I hadn\u2019t bought it in a while so it slipped my mind.  I completely understand that these things are really stupid, and I don\u2019t know why but my mind\u2019s just been slipping on a *lot* of things lately. This is why I feel like he's partially justified in his reaction. I get why he\u2019s frustrated.\n\nLast night, I did laundry because we were cleaning his room. I didn't do all of it because we both work all weekend and I didn't think he'd need much besides his work clothes. I should've done two loads I guess. [This](https://imgur.com/a/QD9Y1ku) was his reaction to it when he found out (I didn't stay over tonight). He hasn't texted me since.\n\nHe probably calls me stupid, retarded, and sometimes autistic at least once a day. I understand that the things I do are really frustrating; they're frustrating to me to. But I almost feel like my absent-mindedness has gotten worse since he's been getting angry about it. I've brought it up to him that him calling me stupid so often really hurts my self-esteem and makes me feel disrespected, but he just says that he shouldn't have to lie and sugar coat everything because my stupidity really frustrates him. And I kind of get that. I feel stupid even writing this all out, like I should just stop being such so absent minded and this wouldn't be a problem. I just want to know whether I'm justified at all in this. I'm just kinda lost. Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: I have been really stupid/absent minded about things lately and it frustrates my boyfriend to the point of calling me stupid every single time it happens.

He goes through the door and just lets the door swing to so the person in the wheelchair has to try and grab it. I stopped to hold the other door for an elderly couple, both with canes, and my fiancee is still walking off, hasn't noticed I stopped. I catch up with him and mentioned that he basically let the door swing shut on a guy in a wheelchair/couldn't you have held it for him? kind of thing.

Near the end of the relationship, I didn't like what is was turning into so I was the one to break it off. Needless to say, it was a messy break off.

Long story short, she fed a story to her  parents on how we were dating for 3 years and that I was ashamed to be seen with her and that I was neglecting my responsibility to my child. I do some digging and found another man and ask her how she knows this woman. The details he told me line up with the time I broke it off with her. He ended up sleeping with her 3 months after our relationship was done. Eventually, the other man gets tested and it comes back he's not the father. Due to the circumstances at the time I accepted the fact that this was my child.

He ultimately petitioned the court to stop the child support. However he found a way to get my money back. At this point we complete the steps necessary to file a claim against my old fwb.

Things like him constantly asking for it and pushing me until I cave after I say no. Also the fact that I'm never allowed to finish. The second he's done he won't touch me anymore. But my biggest concern is the fact he uses his phone while we are being intimate.\n\nNow, it doesn't bother me because I think he's bored and wants to play a phone game. It bothers me because I know him and his previous girlfriend liked to record themselves having sex a lot. Not to mention he only uses his phone when I'm facing away from him during. I've made it abundantly clear that I don't want to ever record us and he said that was fine. I don't necessarily think that he IS recording me but the idea that he has his phone facing me when I can't fully see him is something that bothers me immensely. I've brought this up many times and asked him for my own comfort to not use his phone while we have sex.  He always assures me that he would never record me without my consent but continues to use it when the thinks I can't see. If I ever look over my shoulder I always see it in his hand and he'll immediately drop it.\n\nI even stopped in the middle of it yesterday because we had literally just had a conversation about it 5 minutes prior and lo and behold he was holding his phone. I left the room and hid in the bathroom because I was upset. He pleaded me to come back and promised he wouldn't do it again. I only agreed after he put his phone on top of his TV out of reach until we were done. I feel like this is fucking ridiculous. He's really upset and hurt that I don't trust him. In turn I'm really upset and hurt that he's being untrustworthy by not following one simple thing I ask if him for my own piece of mind. What should I do? Our relationship is fine otherwise, I just don't understand why he can't leave his phone alone for 10 minutes when he knows how much it upsets me. Especially since he swears he would never record me.\n\nI should also mention he has about 4 thumb drives sitting in a drawer that he claims is his porn stash.

I really care about her, I think she's beautiful, we seem to understand each other well, and I love spending time with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought us both matching iPads for Christmas last year and I broke mine a few days ago, she never uses hers so I grabbed it today while she was at school and I started using it. The problem was that as soon as I turned it on and it connected to WiFi, all her messages started coming in. I'll be honest, I did get curious and I probably shouldn't have read them, but I did. It didn't take long before I noticed the messages were about me. It was her and her friend talking over Instagram... To summarize the conversation, It was her friend telling her that Annas ex was newly single again and that she should leave me for him. It was painful to read. Anna shared a lot of intimate details about us and about her ex, she compared us sexually, everything from penis size to positions. She compared the way we talk, the movies and music we like, she even talked about how she didn't like my family. This went on for a long time and she told her friend everything she didn't like about me. The biggest thing that caught my eye was that Anna said she could never see herself marrying me cause I don't make as much money as her ex. I know her ex, I'm sure he does well financially, but its the first time I've ever heard Anna bring up money. It really caught me off guard to hear my girlfriend say that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's the truth. I've been keeping a secret. Something Anna doesn't even know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished high school, I didn't want to take out student loans, so I got a full time sales job at a car dealership and started a small business on the side. All this in hopes to save as much money as I could and pay for college later on. Well long story short, I never went to college, my business took off. I started making a good amount of money, enough to quit my sales job and move the business out of my moms garage and into a real commercial building. I struggled a lot and burned myself out for years. But all the hard work paid off cause before I knew it, I was overseeing multiple branches of my store, I had partnered with a well known franchise, and I was making more money than I ever imagined... Then things got better! Someone offered to buy everything. My entire business... Truth be told, I was tired of the day-to-day operation, and the money was too much to turn down, so I sold... I was careful with the money, I talked to the right people, and to be as vague as possible, most of that money is invested and is making me a decent return. My \"day job\" now is managing my investments and looking over my finances. She knows none of this. In fact, no one really knows. My closest friends and family are the only ones who know of my success. I haven't shared this with any of the girls I dated before Anna either. I always imagined keeping it a secret until I was ready to marry someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really surprised me to hear her talk like this. It really fucking hurt to read my girlfriend type out every single thing she hates about me and compare me to her ex boyfriend. I know its my fault for snooping but I never expected this from her. And even putting the money aside, it really sounds like she prefers her ex over me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I have no idea what to do. I definitely feel some guilt over not sharing all this with her, but I also didn't want her to only like me cause of the money.. Do I tell her I saw the messages? Do I tell her about the money? If I tell her about the money and she stays with me, how can I trust she actually loves me and not just the money? Do I just break up with her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Read girlfriends messages where she compares me with her ex, she says she prefers him. She prefers him cause she thinks he makes more money.

It\u2019s a complicated situation, but I\u2019ll do my best to give the key details. My boyfriend (I\u2019ll call him **George**) and I have been in an on-and-off relationship for the past five years. We met in college, and got together then, but broke it off when he moved to Seattle. When he moved back to New York, that was two years ago, we dated other people but still kept in touch. In the past few months, I was seeing a guy (let\u2019s call him **Axel**) on and off, too. He was kind of a hot mess, but he made me feel good about myself. I\u2019ve never been the most confident about my body, I always felt a little too chubby, and I guess Axel was what I needed at that moment. Someone who made me feel wanted. \n\nThe thing is, I broke it off with Axel a month ago, because I realized that ultimately, I really do love George. We met for coffee, and we just sort of realized we should be together. I\u2019m not lying when I say it was one of the most meaningful  moments in my life. It\u2019s hard to explain, but everything seemed to come together for me. Like I finally understood what I was supposed to do. For a long time, I felt so directionless in my job, and just in general. George makes me feel safe. I don\u2019t want to get cheesey, but you know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re really in love. \n\nSo George and I made tentative plans to move in together relatively soon (within a month). I know it might seem fast, but we\u2019ve known each other for five years and even though it was on and off, we were always close. And then things started going bad. I got the first obvious sign when I missed my period. And then I guess when I was on my third week (that\u2019s what my doctor says) when I started getting intense morning sickness. I was waking up and immediately puking. I feared the worst and got a test, which came out positive. My doctor confirmed it with a blood test. I was four weeks in. \n\nI know it was Axel because he was the only guy I was sleeping with. Yes I was on birth control. Yes we used condoms. But I was devastated. I confided in my girlfriends, which was hard on its own, and I couldn\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t know what to do. I know I\u2019m not ready for a child, I know I want to have an abortion. I won\u2019t pretend like I don\u2019t have any conflicts over it. My parents are conservative (I\u2019m not) and I guess those values still hold sway over me, but ultimately I believe I should be allowed to make choices concerning my body, and I don\u2019t feel guilty for having an abortion. \n\nWhat I do feel horrible about is George. Like I said, we started talking about moving in together. He\u2019s really excited about it, and wants to start looking for apartments. I just don\u2019t know how to break it to him. Regardless of whether I get an abortion or not, I feel like he\u2019ll see me differently. Even if I really don\u2019t have any feelings for Axel, and it was an accident (it was). I know in my heart that he\u2019s not judgmental about sex and relationships and all that. I know he slept with other women, and he assumes I slept with other guys. But I feel like pregnancy and a possible abortion hold a lot more gravity. It\u2019s a lot more serious. I just don\u2019t want to fuck up what I consider the best thing in my life. I feel like I\u2019ve fucked up so much else in my past (which I won\u2019t get into) and I can\u2019t imagine my life without him. \n\nPlease, someone tell me what to do. I feel like I\u2019m going to have a breakdown. Should I just tell him outright? One of my friends said I should get the abortion and not tell him, since it's my issue, and it's mine alone (or with Axel) to deal with. But that just felt dishonest to me. If I were George I'd want to know. I'm so confused. I can barely get out of bed.\n\ntldr; I unknowingly got pregnant with another guy before reuniting with the person I love.

He recently got accepted into a doctoral program that is 2 hours away and we decided it was finally the time to move in together and we moved to where his school was in June. It was hard for me at first because he was so busy and I had no one but I know he was doing this for his future and was happy for him. \n\nI have met the people he hangs out with and lot of them seem like bad influences such as flirting and cheating with on their bf or gfs. They are all younger than my boyfriend (22-24) and he always says he feels left out and no one likes him. I told him just be himself and people will, it takes time to make real friends. Anyways this sorta made me kinda nervous because I was scared he\u2019ll do it too, but he promised me he wasn\u2019t like them until 4 days ago, I saw a girl messaging him constantly who is from his program that he sees every day, I did decide to creep and I saw the messages they weren\u2019t that bad but still gave me an uncomfortable feeling. Then I kinda brought it up that I feel like a line shouldn\u2019t be crossed, and that he can have friends who are girls but they are boundaries. He agreed told me he loved me and we cuddled and he said don\u2019t worry it\u2019s only you. The next day seemed perfectly fine I didn\u2019t bother him about it until at 10pm he gets a message from her and he actually shows me and his conversation with her only had 4 messages from last hour. I was like why did you delete the messages and he\u2019s like cause u already saw the other ones from the other day and that made you uncomfortable so I decided to delete them. I was like I already saw them why delete them? Anyways I got a really weird gut feeling in my stomach and I decided to just let it go and we kissed and cuddled and fell asleep. The next morning I wake up and he goes to shower and he took his phone but I had a weird gut feeling in my stomach that something wasn\u2019t right so I had to look and guess what I found the messages he deleted from the day before, he was flirting with her and making gross sexual comments to her all day yesterday. My stomach dropped, I felt so sick that I ran to the bathroom and confronted him while taking a shower. He said no he wasn\u2019t cheating and I was like I saw your fucking messages. He kept denying and we argue for a little then he had to go to school. He told me to wait and don\u2019t leave. I told him I wouldn\u2019t be there when he gets back from school. I packed my shit up and left back to my parents house, I been so alone cause no one is at my parents house. It\u2019s been hard. We talked a little but it got so toxic that I just had to block him.\n\nI decided just to leave because If he can do that to me while I quit my job to move in with him and supported him at his new school somewhere new and he decides to cheat on me, then there\u2019s no changing. I will be constantly angry there and questioning who he talking to or what he doing. \n\nI\u2019m lonely and sad now. I miss him but also remember what he did and get angry and want to tell him how angry I am. There was red flags throughout our relationship and I could have left sooner but I loved him and saw a future. I don\u2019t know how to move on.

We have 3 kids in elementary school.  Her issues consisted of I'm not involved enough with kids, she was tired of my moods/ temper. We would have these big fights every 6 months over little dumb annoyances that built up over time. She was just tired of dealing with me and wanted to move on. My complaint was she was mean to me and we had a mismatch in libido (she only wanted it once a month, I wanted it daily-weekly within reason). \n\nNow backing the story up a little, she was having bone pain in her shin starting in 2017. The doctors thought it was an injury. Never got better after physical therapy. Then they thought it was a bone infection. Then they finally said in Fall of 2018 that it was bone cancer. That threw our lives into turmoil with trying to understand what it meant and going to many, many chemo treatments, and everything. Then she had surgery to remove the section of bone with cancer and replace it with a bone graft and metal.\n\nFor a year she hasn't been able to walk or drive.  We went to probably over a hundred doctor's appointments.  Had no physical intimacy and barely even touched at all. I started to get emotionally distant. I felt resentment when fearing that when this was all over, she would go back into wanting to dump me and move on with her life.  I've helped her as a caregiver reluctantly the whole time, but she could see through it.  I was helping her because I felt like I had to, not really because I wanted to. It was a super hard year.\n\nThere were all kinds of twists and turns along the path but anyway, bringing us to now, she's cancer-free and we're trying to rebuild some kind of life. We're going back to marriage counseling. I keep hearing myself say things like \"why should I be fully invested in our relationship when I don't believe that she really loves me or respects me\". I say those things and it sounds weird coming out of my mouth.\n\nI'm lonely, sad, starved for affection, and not sure how to make anything better. Shes still recovering so I don't think she really wants to deal with my thoughts and feelings. It seems like if I just keep my mouth shut and love her unconditionally that she'd be happy.

I don\u2019t know why but he absolutely hates him and makes his live a living hell. Harry is a sweetheart, kind of the quiet kid who only talks if he has to. We do family gathering every Sunday so they see each other every week, and since this year they go to the same school. \n\n\nAnyway to keep things short, a few weeks ago, a tired Harry had enough and just lost it and beat the shit out of Dudley in front of Dudley\u2019s friends. It was ugly and humiliating as my nephew is very popular and admired, you know the stereotype of the bully. \n\n\n\nDudley\u2019s mom (Petunia) never accepted to talk to his son about his behavior. She always said that Harry should man up and defend himself if that bother him so much. \n\n\n\nWell I guess he did, and it was ugly. \n\n\n\n\nPetunia is absolutely furious and wants Harry to apologize to her son. She also wants my other sister, Harry\u2019s mom (let\u2019s call her Lily) to ground him and take away his computer, games and book. She\u2019s threatening to press charges. My mom told me that she thinks Lily should hit her son for  hurting her Dudley so badly but I don\u2019t think she meant it. \n\n\n\nWe (mom and dad and grandma and brother+ in-laws) are honestly so happy and proud (we really tried everything we could to make Dudley stop but the mother was in denial and our only solution was to keep an eye on my nephew when he was around) that Harry finally defended himself that we can\u2019t hide our satisfaction and my sister is outraged. She doesn\u2019t talk to us anymore and blocked us everywhere. \n\n\nLily is so happy that she can\u2019t held her smug face each time she sees my other sister. She smiles way more and is very relaxed now, as if she had been waiting for this all her life. \n\n\nPetunia and lily where very good friends before, they lived their pregnancy together, but their relationship became very complicated when Dudley started to abuse Harry. I think he\u2019s jealous of Harry (parents in love, lovely home, good grades, effortlessly funny when he decides to talk, good health. Dudley\u2019s life is chaotic because of Petunias multiple boyfriend and inability to keep a job)\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do to move forward as a family. I\u2019m relieved Harry stood for himself but violence isn\u2019t a solution and he really hurt Dudley. I don\u2019t really like Dudley but he\u2019s my nephew and I still hope he decides to become a decent human being. I guess I should scold Harry but I don\u2019t want to. I want to reach to Dudley but I don\u2019t know how. \n\nAny advice \n\nTl; dr: quiet kid beat up bully. Bully\u2019s mom is furious. Quiet kid mom is unapologetic.

I wasn't comfortable with him and her interactions but there was nothing specifically flirty - just seemed odd they both went to the bar and I'd never heard of him.\n\nOn my way back I texted her that I was uncomfortable with the situation and she remarked that I was being insecure, which I was, and that it wasn't a big deal. I said I still would prefer her to not actively look to hang out with him. She agreed. \n\nThe next night she askes me to watch the baby so she can visit a friend, Stacy, with her work friend Samantha. I say sure just don't drive drunk and keep me up to date on what's going on. She texts me around 9 and says she's drunk she wants me to come get her, which I agree to, but she quickly cancels and says she'll get an Uber so we don't wake the baby. About an hour later she says she's decided to go back out. I text her around 11 to see what's going on with no response. Around 2 am she comes home and we argue because she drove drunk. The next morning I ask her to tell me about the night and she does - went to Stacy's, left to a bar, went back to Stacy's and then drove home. Mentions Stacy's husband and Samantha were there. \n\nAt some point after, my GF tells me that Hugh has been cheating on his wife and confided in her. I take it as him signaling to her but she just tells me they're friends. \n\nTwo weeks later I am with Hugh and my GF, at a work event, and he casually mentions how drunk my GF was the night I previously described and makes it clear he was there that night. \n\nOn the car ride home, I confront her about it. I am beside myself. She admits she didn't tell me because she knew I'd be mad and states that he was just at the bar by coincidence. They had no idea - it was just a popular bar by their work and Hugh was with his mistress anyway. We argue but I eventually take her word. \n\nNow, a few days ago, while she was napping, she got a message for a side project that I've been helping her with. I go to respond to the message and she gets a text from Hugh. I clicked on it but it was innocuous - a meme about work. I then noticed that there were only five total text messages from Alex and none from before October 2nd. This was important because I had started car pooling with her and remembered him texting her our first day car pooling which was Sept 23rd. \n\nSo I check phone records and see messages, I counted at least thirty, from before October 2nd. Naturally I am believing the worst at this point. She actively deleted her messages - why would you do that? \n\nI confront her and she admits she did immediately. I accuse her of cheating and she denies stating she only deleted the texts because she knew I would get mad. I ask her what was in the texts she replies \"nothing just crap about work and him sending me pictures of him at the bar with his mistress.\" I ask if it was the night she omitted he was there and she says yeah not knowing she admitted to lying to me. \n\nI call her out again - you told me it was a coincidence. She says it was hazy because she was drunk. She didn't remember, obviously lying again. Eventually she admits she lied and that he asked her to come out and she agreed but everything was to prevent me from getting upset since I didn't like the guy. \n\n\nShe swears she's not cheating but my intuition is screaming it's too many lies. I'm hurt that she even lied to me but I don't want to tear apart my family on a hunch. We had it out again tonight and she was very upset I brought it up. She thinks I'm overreacting and that she only had to lie because I was being unreasonable. \n\nAm I being unreasonable or just ignoring the writing on the wall?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2124155, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GF (29) lied to me (33) repeatedly", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572123818, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djj9nk/gf_29_lied_to_me_33_repeatedly/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NotAThrowaway123321", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_clyjd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571369166, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djhloi/girlfriend_accusing_my_lab_partner_of_trying_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "djhloi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 76, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/djhloi/girlfriend_accusing_my_lab_partner_of_trying_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571369169, "score": 152, "selftext": "So, I'm \\[27\\] in an introductory biology course and have a lab partner who we will name Melanie.

This morning, after class, the class went to the lab to inspect agar plates that were stored in the incubator.  I skipped out, having to rush home to attend to other matters and my lab partner called me to ask why I wasn't in lab.  The call lasted for a total of 50 seconds where I explained that I would get pictures later in the day.

After we talked about it for a few minutes and I explained to her that it was all platonic and nothing to worry about.

I told him how I was feeling about what he was doing, how it hurt me what he said, how I miss our sex life and how I felt he was being manipulative and childish. He responded really well honestly, and he agreed the way he acted was unacceptable and he was very apologetic.\n\nHe clarified what he meant about not liking vaginas, he said that going down on me isn't his favourite thing to do but he does it because he wants me to feel good and please me. He said that he overreacted by withdrawing from sex, but he said he just felt frustrated because he feels like I don't compromise anything for him and apparently I don't do things just to make him feel good unless it benefits me.\n\nThis was kinda hard to hear because the more he said the more it made sense and I felt pretty guilty and selfish. He said that he obviously enjoyed the sex but he felt like it was very one-sided and he just wanted a little more pleasure for himself, which is why he brought up his anal kink. I still can't bring myself to change my mind on this. A lot of people in the last post suggested we weren't sexually compatible but I don't want to just give up on this relationship without at least trying to make a change.\n\nWe agreed to make to re-evaluate our sexual relationship and make some compromises for the sake of each of our own sexual satisfaction. I still won't budge on my boundaries about anal sex, and he is ok with that. He is going to keep that as a solo activity, and he is going to try the butt plug suggestion I made the first time. He also agreed to go back to how things were and we would continue to have vaginal and oral intercourse. I am also going to make an effort to make sex more enjoyable for him and try and be less selfish in the bedroom. It is going to be baby steps for now but I am going to start by trying to reciprocate oral sex, and he is very excited.\n\nWe both agreed to make an effort to work through this and I am happy this little dispute is behind us.

She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.\n\nWe sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she \"betrayed my trust\" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not \"forgiving mom\" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother.

He and I had 1 prior relationship before dating. I told him to say what is on his mind, and it hasnt been a problem. We'd go shopping and he'd (by my prompting for him to say it aloud!) mention he cant wait to buy me nice clothes from some of this stores instead of the same store over and over. We'd pass healthly size mannequins and he mentioned that he never expects me to be thin, but he prefers something about that or a little larger. I told him thats realistic and i planned to lose weight to be a size Large/18 (us womens) and im excited too.\n\n\n\n#weightloss\n\n\nSo, my weight was getting out of control, i started feeling the health issues and started dieting which turned to intermittent fasting. Over 2 years thats a little over 1lbs a week. It wasnt drastic, but for a while now, everyones noticed ive slimmed down, mostly (imo) because ive finally bought/wear clothes that fit. Nothing hoochie, just clothes in my size.\n\n\n\n\n#bfs insecurities and weight\n\n\nSo, a few months ago my bf admitted that he couldnt be intimate with me because when he sees me, he sees that fact he didnt lose weight with me. My progress makes him ashamed, and he asked me to be tougher on his diet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts tough because he has the means to eat at work everyday. So he eats whatever he wants (they have great food) and then comes home, says he isnt hungry, and to find him eating at his desk the snacks he bought from amazon and snuck in! So its impossible, he has to make the choice, which hes done a decent job switching out candy for apples and soda for diet and water.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dont mind his weight but he cant put his weight responsibility 100% on me. \n\n\n\n\n#the \"bullying\"\n\n\nIn the last 2 weeks, my bf has been saying really mean things. He complains about everything I do, everything im not doing enough of ect. It was easy to avoid id just head upstairs to play games or just nod to let him vent.\n\n\n\n\n\n#But now he has gotten more cruel.\n\n\nHe is constantly saying I stink. I am not working out, i love showers and take too many, and even when i was fat i didnt sweat or stink. I am insecure about my smell because of my families stigma on my weight and tan skin (to them it didnt matter how i smelled, being fat = stinky, being tanner than them =stinky)\n\n\n\nI can smell myself, ask classmates, and i dont stink. I bend down to smell there, and although its bad for me, it still smells scented from all the stuff i use on myself.\n\n\n\nHes been making it into a bigger deal, if i lay next to him at bedtime (typically i go after he sleeps since i stay up) hell snap at me and call me stinky and say its so bad and beg me to shower. Even though i did in the evening already.\n\n\n\nSo i started only taking showers right before bed.\n\n\n\n I love the teeny and few birthmarks i have. He has a lot or birthmarks freckles, and moles so I don't know what his problem is but he grabs my arm and theres this little birthmark dot on my wrist and he goes,\" oh, sorry!

I told him if he needs to he can, but he said he has work.\n\n\n\n\nJust now, maybe in thinking that he wanted a gf to just make him feel better about himself? Fat gf but not too fat, asian so he thinks im subservient (which i warned him im not demure but he doesnt mind) i cook and do most chores, we game together (but not as much anymore....) im just so confused.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, i did not lose my breasts, so thats not why he is uninterested. \n\n\n\n\n\nDoes he want to break up with me?

Causing lots of fights and resentment. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for almost 2 years, we did LDR for a year and I moved to be with him 7 months ago. Now throughout our relationship my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex (Amy, she had broken up with him a few months prior and they had dated on and off for a year) had taken it upon herself to contact him multiple times, the first time was early on trying to get him back, second time her friends wanted to make t-shirts saying \u201cTeam Amy\u201d in an effort to seclude me from my fianc\u00e9\u2019s life and they get back together, and the third time was a message saying that she hopes he\u2019s happy and that her thoughts and doubts don\u2019t matter. \n\nDuring each of these instances I was on the east coast and not near my fianc\u00e9 but he let me know and did not respond to his ex. However by the third instance I was tired of constantly dealing with this, I asked my fianc\u00e9 to block her off all platforms which he did. (Took a lot of courage to ask that of him)\n\nTo make matters more unlucky, my FSIL is best friends with his ex, they refer to themselves as sisters often. So I will forever be dealing with this woman. \n\nAfter my fianc\u00e9 received the third message and he blocked her, a week later I fly to him for the weekend and we go to a football game, we run into my FSIL and FBIL, they had extra tickets and wanted us to sit with them.  We were very excited to sit with them and it wasn\u2019t until we were at the gate that my FSIL said that my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex would also be sitting with us. I was floored and felt ambushed to be nice to someone I could not stand. Twenty minutes into the game I left but eventually came back a half hour before the game ended. Since then I have spoken very outwardly to my fianc\u00e9 about my dislike for the ex and have questioned the motives of why my FSIL left that information out until last minute for that event. \n\nA month into me moving here, FSIL invited us to her child\u2019s birthday party. I saw on the invite list that the ex was also attending. I texted her and explained that I was uncomfortable being around the ex and would not be attending the birthday party, it was a long heartfelt text trying to talk to her about it. My FSIL didn\u2019t reply until later in the day on a group chat with the entire family calling me selfish and vindictive to try and cut out her best friend. I immediately called her and was furious but still tried to be respectful to her even though she took the approach of involving everyone in the family when I attempted talked to her privately. Somehow this call ended with me on the phone with the EX! I was ready to pack my bags, get on a plane and leave this hick jerry springer episode. \n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 how upset I was over all of this and he didn\u2019t attempt to step in at all while his SIL verbally gut punched me. In the end I gave in and went to this birthday party begrudgingly and left early. Like made my appearance and now I\u2019m gone. \n\nNow fast forward 6 months in, I now work at a job where the ex\u2019s friend works, I\u2019m on a fantasy football team with the ex, and have to see the ex at parties. Needless to say I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019m so tired of dealing with all of this and my fianc\u00e9 and I fighting about it. Last night he had a notification on his phone and I checked it (nothing unusual for us to do to each other\u2019s phones) and I see he\u2019s friends with his exes family members. My demeanor immediately changed after seeing it. He said he\u2019d delete them and I said do whatever you want, I\u2019m tired of seeing your ex in my life and my fianc\u00e9 and I got into another fight. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. The ex will always be in my life it seems, I\u2019m ready to give up and just go home.

The text was just from an advisor at her school and she showed me the conversation they were having, but her reaction to that made me have a subtle suspicion. So later that night, I looked through her phone. I\u2019ve had the password to her phone a week after we started dating, she just gave it to me, and I never went through her phone until that day...\n\nI went to a group chat that she has with two of her friends and this is where i saw the heartbreaking text messages. Basically, she started a random conversation about this guy at her university saying, \u201cif you see this guy... I always knew I was destined to marry a doctor\u201d. Now, I\u2019m not a doctor nor do I plan to be, and her two friends both know that she is in a relationship with me. And yet, they inquired about this guy, so my gf goes on to describe how he looks. And she tells them that he gave her his number, but he has a gf. She told them he\u2019d be a doctor in two years and then \u201dit\u2019s yes dr daddy\u201d. And when my gf mentioned that this guy was in a relationship she expressed vexation over this. And one of her friends says \u201cI hope you look nice\u201d and my gf\u2019s response was \u201crelatively\u201d. Then another friend said to \u201cFaceTime him and show him your pussy\u201d but then said \u201cnvm\u201d after the mention of this guy\u2019s gf, but my gf said \u201cno not nvm lol\u201d. And they say for her to take a picture of him, and my gf tries to get one, it was a blurry video, the guy was outside of the building, four stories down, just minding his own business. Then her friends says that she should hope he breaks up with his gf, and my gf replied with what she says was a quote from a meme on twitter \u201cif you need a shoulder to cry on you can always shove your dick down my throat or you know give me a call\u201d. And that was the end of the conversation about this guy. Later after I confront her she tells me that she didn\u2019t exchange numbers with him, and that he was just sending her information about an apartment, and I saw the message and it was indeed from his email.\n\nSo a week goes by, she\u2019s been begging to stay with me and being very manipulative, for instance, a day after I confronted her she went through my phone and deleted the screenshots of these images, telling me it was for the best. She also told me that if I left her the next thing I would hear of her is that she died. She\u2019s been pleading and telling me She will do whatever it takes, all the usually sob story-type stuff people say when they exhaust every other means of getting what they want.\n\nAnd I realized something, the date of the messages was during a time where we had a major fight. Basically she saw something on my story that she didn\u2019t like and I woke up to a series of messgaes from her being extremely rude and disrespectful. And I remember thinking at the time before I even replied that she must have met someone else because the way she was talking to me it was like she didn\u2019t care about me. So this argument went on the entire day and into the next, and she was unapologetic and saying things like \u201cyou fucking disappoint me\u201d, just things that she never said to me before. And I that time I felt like she stopped caring and probably met someone else. The next day is when she sent these messages in her group chat. I checked the time stamp, and I saw that she sent me a message saying that her disrespect was just \u201ctough love\u201d and that I \u201cmean much\u201d to her, and then LITERALLY the next minute she was in the group chat talking about this guy. She told me she didn\u2019t think about the argument when she sent the messages, she said she didn\u2019t think at all. But it was literally one minute later.\n\nShe said it was all a joke, and she didn\u2019t mean any of it. She doesn\u2019t have a history of doing anything behind my back, or things that make me question her loyalty. She\u2019s never out late, or hanging out with any guys. That\u2019s why it\u2019s sort of difficult to leave her, even though I technically have already.

He was so cute and charming, and I\u2019m usually awkward around new people so I was excited to meet someone who could make conversation so easily. There was just one thing, he\u2019s kind of a lot older than me (29) so I was nervous at first. We went on a few dates and they went amazing, we connected instantly. \n\nWe became exclusive quickly and everything was perfect. He would bring me flowers and little gifts for no reason. He said he loved my brain and my attitude towards life. He assured me he wasn\u2019t just in this so he could fuck a younger girl, that he really wanted to be with me. He told me that I was really mature anyways and that he didn\u2019t even think about the age difference most of the time. I think he put me on a pedestal at times, he said I was the most beautiful girl he\u2019d ever seen and I\u2019d often catch him staring at me in a cute way. I\u2019m really not that objectively pretty but I loved how he made me feel like I was really that beautiful. My roommates at my apartment are absolute nightmares so I started staying over at his place more and more, for the last month or so I\u2019ve basically been staying over every night and it\u2019s made us so close...I mean after sex we just lay under the covers and talk for hours until I fall asleep in his arms. \n\nTwo weeks ago. Is when it all turned to shit. I left Leo\u2019s house that day to go to class as normal. We had wonderful morning sex and then he kissed me and said he loved me as I left. Everything was great.

I offered to come over and take care of him but he said no as he didn\u2019t want me to him like this and prefers to be alone when he\u2019s sick. \n\nThat was the last I\u2019ve heard from him. Two days was weird but I figured he was really sick and sleeping. After that I started blowing up his phone, he blocked me on everything. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening and I literally didn\u2019t get out of bed for days (skipped my damn classes over him) because I had no idea what I\u2019d done to make him leave me so coldly and not even tell me why. I even went to house once, creepy I know but I just needed to see him. Well he wasn\u2019t even there so it was pointless. \n\nLast night, I received a call from a number I didn\u2019t recognize so I didn\u2019t pick up. Then I got a text \n\n\u201cHello ___, my name is ___. I am Leo\u2019s wife. I believe we have a lot to talk about. I would like to meet with you.\u201d \n\nI immediately was sure I was being pranked by one of my friends (we have a bit of a twisted sense of hunor, tbh I would\u2019ve found it kind of funny) so I just responded with \u201cnice.\u201d and shortly after \u201cwait who is this?\u201d She told me this was not a joke and sent their wedding photo along with other pictures. She also told me that she had been out of the country for work. And she had just returned. \n\nAll of this is about 100X more than I can viably handle. I\u2019m fucking heartbroken that this guy I fell in love with, and who I thought loved me, could just cut me off without any notice like I\u2019m nothing. I feel trashy for being the other woman even though I didn\u2019t know. I feel like a stupid little girl for thinking that I had found something amazing with Leo. And I feel extreme guilt over the fact that I\u2019ve ruined a literal MARRIAGE. I can\u2019t stop crying and I just wanted this to not have happened. I flip flop between hating Leo\u2019s guts and hoping he dies alone, and just wanting to be in his arms again. He knows how to comfort me like no one else and if this were any other situation making me so upset, he is the one I would go to. He would kiss my forehead and tell me that everything was okay and if it wasn\u2019t he would make it so. I felt so safe with him. But it was all a complete lie I guess. I don\u2019t know what his actual reasoning for doing this was. I don\u2019t know if I ever want to speak with him again but I have so many questions. \n\nI also haven\u2019t responded to his wife yet about meeting her. I probably should but I know I will cry and be a mess when we talk about Leo. At least she knows I didn\u2019t know about her.

This is my first time posting on this sub, I am on mobile, and I am at my wit\u2019s end here. \n\nBackstory: I love my fianc\u00e9e. She\u2019s a good person. She is fun, she makes me laugh, she is the person that I want to spend the rest of my life with. Except for... this one quirk.\n\nShe is OBSESSED with soap. Not in a germaphobe way, but with buying it. We have little hand soaps and soap bars shaped like various things everywhere in our house. If there is water, you best believe there is a weird amount of soap nearby. At first, I thought it was cute. I would get her bar of soap from Lush (if you don\u2019t know what Lush is, its like organic skincare and soaps, very expensive) and she\u2019d love it! She was happy, I was happy. Then we moved in together almost a year ago. When we combined things, I guess I didn\u2019t realize just how much soaps and scrubs she had. As of right now, there are currently 12 (twelve!!!) bars of soap in our bathroom alone. 7 of them opened and half used! And that\u2019s just one bathroom. \n\nIt\u2019s not even the clutter that it causes, it\u2019s the money. Any craft fair or marketplace she goes to, more soap. Anytime she goes to the mall or supermarket, another bar of soap! A lot of times she claims that she is helping small businesses. Which, in some cases she is, but she doesn\u2019t need to help them THAT much. She has a good job, she earns money, and our finances are separate. So I can\u2019t exactly ask her to stop wasting her money on soap, because it is HER money. I have tried to talk to her about this before, and she gets upset. And, for the most part, her points are valid. It\u2019s her money, it\u2019s not the worst thing to collect, it eventually gets used, and it\u2019s better than buying plastic bottles of soap. Sure, I get it, but we probably have 50+ bars of soap in our house right now. All of various scents and sizes and ingredients. \n\nIt has gotten to a point where it is starting to cause big arguments, because we need to save money for our wedding coming up and a house. We also want to get a dog, but I don\u2019t think we should have a dog running around when we have soap bars on almost every counter. And what about when we have kids! A lot of these soaps have poppyseeds or plants or other random things in them, which could really harm a baby or animal if they got to it. Sure, you could say to just be careful and keep an eye on the dog or baby, but the soap is even under our counters and in drawers. \n\nSeriously, I wish I could gather them all up and take a picture of them, but I wouldn\u2019t even begin to know how to put them back. Then she\u2019d ask why her soaps are all moved around, and I can\u2019t exactly be line \u201cwell babe, I had to ask Reddit what the hell i\u2019m supposed to do about you and all this soap\u201d. \n\nSo reddit, what should I do? I can\u2019t handle looking at all this soap for the rest of my life, knowing that each bar cost between $5-$20 (lush is VERY expensive).

He is really mental abusive to the extent of telling me he's going to choke me out. Kill me. PunchMe.  Tells me to go kill myaelf.  He has physically hurt me twice in our relationship once breaking a plate over my head the next spitting in my face.  He doesn't do anything but plop his ass in front of the Xbox. He quit his job and didn't work for 6 months. He sat in front of the Xbox the entire 6 months. Which I'm a gamer too but he literally is in front of it every second possible. He doesn't clean he will not cool anything for himself so if I don't feed him he doesn't eat.  I have 3 kids I have to pick up and drop off different times all throughout the week with their other parents. And I work 2 jobs. I have health issues I can't address and don't have a minute to breath. I'm so mentally and physically exhausted. I have to come home on lunch to feed my kids because he doesn't. My kids video call me all so I can get them ready through video call so he doesn't have to lift a finger.\n\nHis unemployment ended with me convincing my work to hire him he has now been there a month and a half. He called off the other day and today is now a no call no show. We are currently homeless living in a hotel paying $1300 a month for a busted up room. His fault we both have evictions in our names.  We cant afford to miss 1 day. And then messing with my job by not going.\n\nWe aren't very sexually active because I don't have time to be and I am exhausted. we are in a hotel with my son here 90% of the time so that makes it difficult too.

And all he does is complain complain complain.\n\nIf he doesn't have weed I have to do everything in my power to scrape up cans, Pennies, borrow money, donate plasma. ANYTHING I have to do. His needs come before all. All of our money goes to weed and energy drinks. \n\nI'm in the car right now outside of our room panicking trying to figure out how to leave. He says he's going to destroy my life worse than my ex did (drugged me, stalked me, keeping my kid for months, setting my parents car on fire, and whole lot of messed up crap) he's saying he will make my parents homeless. He's saying he has no reason to put us all in the ground.   I can't go through this again.  I can't lose everything and have to watch my back 24/7 again.  He is going to take my car in which he doesn't have a licence and I paid for it but the title has both.our names. I don't have people to help me aside from my sister and I can't drag her through that again because she got messed with too by my ex.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like dying. I am alone.

On Mondays, I leave for school at 7:00 AM and come home at 5 PM. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, I'm away from home from 8:15 AM to 8:45 PM because of school, art classes twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays), the climbing wall once a week (Thursdays) and teaching a girl (9F) how to draw on Wednesdays. On Saturdays, I work at a supermarket. I'm away from home from either 6:00 AM to 6:45 PM or 10:00 AM to 11:45 PM (gotta love the train timetables...), depending on the shift. I take a different one every week, because neither me, nor the other girl (22F) that works on Saturdays only, wants to take the later shift, so we swap. \n\nNow, I don't mind coming home late. I'm OK with feeling exhausted almost every day. Because of all of this, my art skills have improved drastically. I started saving money to be able to move out and start working right after I finish school. I stopped dwelling on the heartbreak I've experienced a few months ago. There's only one problem: My family. \n\nTheir schedule is different from mine. All four of them are early birds. They'd like to go to bed at 9 PM and wake up at 5-6. Now, I don't really care about that. To me, they can sleep and get up whenever they please, as long as they don't force me to follow their schedule. Unfortunately, though, they do that exact thing. \n\nWhenever I try to do anything around the house after I come home, I'm met with a tantrum, mostly from my mother, sister or father. I'm not allowed to cook, shower, work on commissions, or even study after 9 PM, because my parents and sister claim that they can hear me press buttons on the computer keyboard, draw on my tablet, rinse brushes (aside from doing commissions digitally, going to school and normal work, I also paint traditionally, and am currently preparing for my first exhibition), smell the food I'm cooking, and it deprives them of their sleep. Terrorizes them. If they could, they'd force me to sleep from 9 PM to 6 AM.\n\nI've already talked to my friend about this situation. After discussing it, I've decided to adjust to my family a bit. Here's what I did:\n\n1. I hung two hooks on top of my door and whenever I wanted to draw or study, I started hanging my thick, dark blanket on them, to muffle the sounds of my keyboard and light coming from my room, once my family falls asleep. This actually helped, until my mother found out about it a week ago. If she or my father sleep through the entire night, I'm good to go. If one of them (or my sister) get up to go to the bathroom and notice the blanket, they'll immediately plunge into my room and throw a tantrum that wakes the entire household up. They'll yell at me for depriving them of their sleep, steal my brushes, and on the next day, the whole family will blame ME for being sleepy the whole day, even though I was only doing what I had to and wasn't the one that started screaming and swearing. \n2. I started showering in the morning at 5:45 AM, after my mother does so and takes the dog on its morning walk, because whenever I tried to do so when I got home, my family was cross. Since I usually work on paintings until midnight, this has deprived me of sleep, since I need at least 7 and a half hours of rest every night. It stopped the shower tantrums, though - at least partially. Whenever I don't wash my hair, I manage to wash my body, teeth, face, comb my hair and get dressed within 15 minutes, just in time for my father to wake up and go to the bathroom to take his shower. Every three days, though, I need to wash my hair, and drying it with a dryer takes 15 minutes, during which I get accused of stalling the bathroom. If I wrap it up in a towel, it takes 3 hours to dry - an hour too much, especially during this time of year, when it's getting colder. \n3. I tried to cook in the mornings on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, when I go to work later. I'm not an expert at preparing meals, though, and although I usually manage to cook my food between 7:40 (when my father leaves for work) and 8:15 (I'm not allowed to cook earlier, because I'm \"crowding the kitchen even though I'm leaving later\"), there are moments when I'm drowsy (I'm a night owl) and although my food's ready on time, I don't have the extra 5 minutes to wash the dishes, which results in a tantrum for not cleaning up after myself when I get home, and having to wash all of the dishes (including the ones my family used) as a punishment. \n4. I prepped meals for Tuesdays and Wednesdays in advance. Every time I've done so, my father or brother took the meals on the next day, claiming that they didn't have time to cook their own food. I offered to make them an extra portion. They turned the offer down. On the next day, my lunch was stolen again. \n\nNow, I understand that people have more serious problems than conflicting schedules. That perhaps I'm selfish for not adjusting to my family. On the other hand, though... I want to leave the house and start working right after graduating from school. Stay in shape on the climbing wall. I want to pass my exams and have a stable network of clients in May 2020. Is there anything else I can do to ease this conflict? Moving out isn't really an option. I earn about 1000 zlotys (250$) every month and renting a room would cost 70-80% of my earnings. Even if I found a cheaper place to live (the cheapest I found was for 600 zlotys (150$) per month), I'd still be forced to quit my art classes and the climbing wall, which cost (in total) 300 zlotys (75 dollars) per month and are funded entirely by my parents. I want to be in shape and ready for work by may, so dropping out of them isn't really an option. \n\nTL:DR Me and my family have conflicting schedules. This has caused arguments. I've made adjustments to ease the conflict, but it has done just as much harm as good. My family didn't adjust at all, because I'm in the minority and they feel like they don't have to.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2121982, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (19F) family (54M, 48F, 16F, 16M) won't let me do anything around the house after 9 PM, even though my schedule forces me to", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572109875, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dj4kb7/my_19f_family_54m_48f_16f_16m_wont_let_me_do/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DefectiveLass", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4svo71p3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571307226, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dj4bdd/in_love_with_but_repulsed_by_my_29f_husband_30m/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dj4bdd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 194, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dj4bdd/in_love_with_but_repulsed_by_my_29f_husband_30m/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571307227, "score": 1090, "selftext": "About us: I am a pregnant full-time graduate student with a full-time job.

Now I happen to know that the total cost of renting the house my parents rent is roughly 700-750 Euro's, as such they were basically asking me an 18 year old with a part time job to cover half the rent  despite my lazy brother (19M) not paying a cent towards rent. Also let me add to this that having your children pay rent is considered to be extremely weird in my country, it basically happens to no one unless their parents are in extreme financial hardship which definitely is not the case here my parents are not rich by any means but my dad makes plenty to live comfortably and our rent is considered extremely low even by local standards. Atop this my wages for the month are around 800 Euro's on a good month but usually more or less around 600 Euro's generally, I tried to get more hours but my job would not let me as I am only a part-time employee.\n\nNow of course I was angry about this but just decided to pay it as I did not want to get kicked out or something, but in the meantime planned for college, getting a college loan, getting a college apartment and getting a new part time job where I was going to study.\n\nTo make a long story short it all worked out, I was allowed to join the college courses I was joining late in the year and I informed my boss a month ago and he was sad to see me go but wished me good luck and I was allowed to finish the last month now yesterday my dad demanded my rent for this month, so I gave him a little over half the money(Around 250 Euro's) And informed him I would be moving out by the start of the next week.\n\nThis turned in to a huge fight where they were yelling at me because they did not want me to move out as I am apparently not old enough(I am legally an adult) and they had already planned my 350 Euro's in to their finances for the next several months, now what do they use my money for you ask? Going out to dinner, going to see movies, buying luxury goods, literally nothing towards paying the actual rent as my parents can easily cover it. So I told them about this and I added that they were really dumb for expecting me to pay them rent and then continue to treat me as if I am their teenage son, literally I still have fucking curfews and shit in place and I told them they were not charging my brother rent so I felt slighted to begin with. \n\nWell they told me to grab my shit and get out, so that is pretty much what I did after demanding they give me 75 Euro's back which was meant to cover my last week at home, at this point I am staying at a good friend of mine who have graciously allowed me to stay the week and store my stuff until I move to my student apartment next week.\n\nNow here is the thing, I sort of need advice as to how to deal with my parents, as I do not want to lose them and their behavior these last 3 months is not representative of the last 18 years, on the other hand I want them to treat me as an adult and apologize for their idiotic behavior towards me, so what to do reddit?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2121724, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When I(18M) turned 18 about 3 months ago my parents informed me I will have to pay rent, so I did.

He said that one of the things that keep someone from depression is knowing they can always leave a bad situation, take his divorce for example. He was depressed because he felt he lacked freedom. Since I have never been married, he said to imagine wanting to eat at one restaurant while someone else wants to eat at another restaurant. He said over time, you will get sick of compromising and resentment will build. I said why not eat at a buffet or food court, and he said what if over time you get sick of those too. I said each person can eat with their friends instead, and he said yes, but over time you do things more and more separately until you are not a couple anymore.\n\nThen he said that was just an example, and another example was visiting his wife\u2019s mom over the weekend. Maybe he just wanted to sit on the couch and watch tv instead. Or maybe he wants to do the dishes when he feels like it and not get yelled at about it by his wife. I asked if he had ever tried marriage counseling, and he said no because he knew he didn\u2019t want to be married. I thought his comments were surprising because he is so actively involved in his kids\u2019 lives. He then made a comment that relationships in general aren\u2019t designed to last, and that after a while you just get sick of being with the same person. He said that you love a car when it is new, but after 10 years you get sick of driving the same car. Maybe he wants to date someone into sports, and then date a goth, so that it keeps things interesting. Also, why did he have to stay with someone he was unhappy with when he can get someone he wasn\u2019t sick of, and that someone could be...prettier. He had stalled before saying \u201cprettier\u201d like he was going to say younger. I blurted out \u201cyou didn\u2019t like your wife just because she got old?\u201d And he said not just old, there were lots of things that just caused resentment to build but that at the end of the day humans aren\u2019t meant to be together forever. And that if you aren\u2019t happy with each other then it\u2019s best to move on. He also said that there is a point in a  relationship where you know it\u2019s over, but you are waiting for them to screw up so that you won\u2019t have to be the bad guy.\n\nIt sounded like he left a woman whom he had 3 kids with over some really small things. He sounded like a jerk in general, am I being too judge here? He is so nice to me, and I have heard him talk to his kids when he calls into meetings from home, his kids always sound really happy around him. I went from having a near-obsessive crush on him for close to two years, being on the brink of finding a new job to date him, and then I hear this.

I was very confused and asked what he meant and he said, \"You know because of the gluten.\"\n\nI have been diagnosed with celiac disease since I was six (and he clearly knows this) so we don't have any gluten/grain flours in the house. I told him that if I was making them, I'd make them like I do all the other baked goods he loves- with a combo of gluten/grain free flours. \n\nHe then said, \"Hmm. I want the gluten ones though.\" I responded that I would not buy or use wheat flour because it would get everywhere and make the kitchen unsafe for me to eat or cook in. We've always had a gluten free kitchen because any cross contamination can make me really sick. \n\nHe got angry and said that it was his birthday and he should get what he wants. I replied that if he wants gluten cupcakes he should absolutely have them, but that he'd need to order them because I wouldn't put myself at risk to make them. \n\nHe rolled his eyes and huffed off saying that I was being ridiculous, it's probably too late to order anything, it would be too expensive anyway, and then locked himself in our room for the rest of the night. I'm on the couch. \n\nHe's never asked me for gluten cupcakes before. I've made tons of baked goods our entire 12 year relationship and he's never done anything but praise them; in fact they're so well received I've made cakes and cupcakes for people at his work for their functions. He seems really upset over what I feel should be a nonissue. I sent him a message asking if we could talk about this and he said if I wouldn't agree to his terms there's nothing to talk about. \n\nI'm honestly flabbergasted because nothing like this has ever happened before. I don't want him to be upset, but I also don't want to get sick. I'm going to try contacting a couple bakeries to see if it's at all possible to have one of them make the cupcakes for a reasonable price, otherwise I'm not sure what to do.

Things are better now. Post is long.\n\n\nOnly a few days after my post, he really went after me for real.  I locked myself into the garage and called his dad to try and help me de-escalate \u2014 and his dad called 911 instead. We had been told repeatedly by his psychiatrist and counselor to avoid police, and I think that advice was totally wrong. Dad drew the final line and I am grateful.  This was a few days before his 18th bday. \n\n\nCops intervened very fast- he had *just* gotten through the door I was barricaded behind and I avoided any serious injury. (He had broken two of my fingers in the garage door but nothing life threatening.) As soon as the cops arrived, he voiced suicidal intention so they were able to take him under a psych hold into a secure unit rather than arresting him for aggravated assault.\n\n\nHe was deemed on his 18th birthday to be not a risk to himself or others. His tox screen was unremarkable- just pot. They released him with 60 days of medication and a new diagnosis of bipolar disorder. I asked him where he wanted to go, bought a ticket, helped him pack and sent him on his way. I told him I would not be supporting him any further. \n\n\nIt was absolutely the hardest thing I ever did.\n\n\nI mostly kept my word RE support and never sent money.  For my own peace of mind, I sent a weekly instacart delivery, kept him on my cell phone plan, and helped enrol him in state healthcare there and paid the (modest) premiums. He moved to the other side of the country, with an (18F) friend living with dad.  The location was a terrible choice- no walkable employment options, difficult commute to their psychiatry appts, and the dad had an opioid problem leading to several arrests/incarcerations. \n\n\nSince  age 15, my kid had a history of leaving my house and in with well-meaning adults (friends\u2019 parents) telling them awful stories about me and had never even applied for a job in his life. Had been mostly or entirely truant from school by the time he turned 17.  For the first few weeks, my kid did things like call me hundreds of times around the clock.  He posted a GoFundMe claiming I kicked him out for being gay, that I called cops on him, etc and sent it to all my friends and relatives he could find on Facebook. I truly thought I had lost the kid for good. As heartbreaking humiliating as that was, I didn\u2019t react and my family and friends almost entirely rallied around me without judgement. \n\n\nMy first glimmer of hope was when he walked 2 miles to attend a doctors appointment.  First sign of voluntary helping himself if that makes sense.  I think living with an actually shitty parent put things in perspective, and maybe the medication helped too. The toxicity stopped within a month. The two kids (my kid and his friend) came to a nearby city to meet me and visit about two months later. While things were hard for them, my kid seemed to finally realize how much he lost by leaving home/being unable to live with his mom. We resumed light daily contact (mostly memes and animal pics etc).\n\n\nThe kids came up with the idea to move to a large and progressive city with public transit. They reached out to the friend\u2019s older (young adult) brother who grew up tough, moved out early and had supported himself ever since. **This was an ideal support person- a good example of how to hustle and get independent, but without the means to enable the kids to just smoke pot and coast/mooch off someone else.**\n\n\nBrother, kids and I made a plan and a timeline together, and I used my savings to contribute to half the deposit and first month rent on a bigger apartment for brother, 2kids and brother\u2019s roommate. This plus plane tickets, basic bed with mattress and very basic clothing for the 2kids (very different climate plus job interview outfits) was still cheaper than any decent inpatient psych or rehab programs fyi. \n\n\nBrother and I kept a group chat with the kids to keep them on task applying for jobs but not making too many suggestions and without any judgement. Both had interviews scheduled before they flew out.\n\n\nHe continues to be compliant with psychiatric care.  Both kids now have jobs. Both kids stay in contact with me.  Both kids are more or less covering their own rent. I sometimes send a little money to the brother to help cover bases, but he holds them accountable.  I\u2019m going to visit them next month (staying in a hotel). I am so so so happy with where we all are right now. \n\n\nAre we all one deliriously happy family going to the pumpkin patch this weekend? Not exactly.  Did my kid finish high school and get accepted to an ivy league? Nope.  Is he seemingly mostly content and finally moving forward in life? Yes. All that matters. \n\n\nMy kid spontaneously texted \u201clove u\u201d a week after they moved, and affection comes more frequently now. Every time I get a \u2018love\u2019 reaction on a text I can\u2019t tell you how it feels. \n\n\n\nTL;DR\nA year ago I thought my kid would kill me.

I first told everything to my boyfriend. He was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. He also respected that I didn't want her to meet him. \n\nI decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. She IMMEDIATELY noticed like within ten minutes after I'd blocked she sent a text saying \"did you block me on instagram and facebook??\" so I didn't beat around the bush, I said yes because I didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. She tried to guilt trip me about how I hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like I knew they would). She exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to \"stalk him or anything\", but I hadn't even gotten a chance to say I was worried she'd do this. She said it first so what does that say?\n\nI told her I flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. She called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. I can't reason with her. She just never sees the problem with anything she's done. The way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.\n\nI blocked her number, I still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. But we live hours apart, so I figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...\n\nThen, as for them, I also got a call from my mom soon after I blocked my sister who wanted to know what I was doing because she was upset. She'd already heard my sister's side which was just that I'd blocked her out of nowhere. So I tried to tell her my side. I did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like I said in the first post I'm not going to fall to petty revenge. I just want her to stop interfering in my life. So all I said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys I've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. My mom then wanted to know what I meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). She also got my dad on the call at this point. I told them the details didn't matter. She kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if I had been having premarital sex. It was really frustrating. \n\nI told them the point I'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. They began saying I should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. Well I'm not exactly fighting. I'm simply not going to be in contact with her. To them it's the same thing. \n\nThen they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. I said I wasn't going to do that, that I'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. They said they'd come to me then. That brought up how they show up for random visits even when I've said I don't like it. I told them I didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again I wouldn't let them in or talk with them. So they flipped out, that was fun, I got to hear all how I'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.\n\nI ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. And blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.\n\nI don't know wtf I'm going to do about them. They did threaten to stop paying for my college if I cut them out of my life. I unblocked them to say I want to be in touch with them and do love them but I can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. I said if they stop doing that then I'm happy to have a relationship with them. They had a million reasons why I'm in the wrong. I couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. So I don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.\n\nMy boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. He thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. He's really helped keep me as sane as I can be. \n\nOverall I just feel really shitty. I wish any of them would ever listen to what I say. But if they won't then what can I do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. It just sucks it has to be so...final, I guess. I wouldn't mind a middle ground like PLANNING a visit with them ONCE IN A WHILE, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than I do. \n\nTL;DR: I'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2120117, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update to My (22F) twin (22F) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends.

By the end of my shift I was left completely alone and when I finally packed my stuff and left I had to walk past the whole group to exit the building. When they saw me they suddenly stopped talking/laughing, I said \u201cGoodbye\u201d and few people replied with what seemed like a really happy and mocking tone \u201cSee you on Monday!\u201d.

When I make sexual jokes, try getting intimate, she says all I want is sex. We're both not even 30 years old yet. \n\n\nI'm honestly starting to feel like crap. At times it just feel like maybe there's just something wrong with me? I'm starting to feel like I might have a perverted mind when I ask her to get intimate.

I was really happy for him, because he could finally talk to people that have the same interest in politics than he has. I tried for years, read a lot of articles, do know what happens in the world and listen to him when he wants to talk about it, but it just does'nt interest me as much as him.\n\nAfter some time, I met some of the \"inner circle\" of the party in our district. There I saw Tina. She is tall, thin, a natural beauty with wild red hair, a lot of confidence and since she is the district leader, a lot of political knowledge. At first I wasnt intimidated, I am smaller than her and have a little bit of chub, but I have gigantic breast, a great sense of humor, am pretty in a special way, smart and also confident. \n\nAfter some time, I recognized some comments from my boyfriend, that I habe never heard towards another woman. Like when she showed us a picture of her in an (very revealing) outfit she was going to wear to a pride parade. He stared at it and just said: \"You DO have tits\". (Her mentioning earlier that she doesnt). Their behavior towards has something of 13 year olds flirting. Giggeling, tickeling, fistbumps on the shoulder and everything. Not to mention locking arms when walking.\n\nSo last weekend, some people of the party, decided to go out for drinks, her and BF included. He came home, fairly drunk, smiling like an Idiot. And telling me that they all together had a round of secret sharing, like something aweful that happend to them. He then said: \"Tina told me some really heavy stuff\". I asked what she talked about. And for the first time, he would\u2019nt tell me. He told me every heavy secret hes ever gotten to know about people around him,like his best friend from college, from his Professor and from a mutual friend (I myself had a some heavy shit happening to me when I was 15-18). After that I just left it at that. But when he started texting, he got that Idiot smile again (you know, the one you get when you stare at someone you love) and I catched a glimpse of the name on the phone, it was her.\n\nThe next day we all went out together again, with her. She was staring at him like he was thing ever. They continued giggling als tickeling and at some point he was like : \" Hey I think Tina wants to talk to me outside, Is it okay if I go?\" I could'nt say no to that. Luckily they did'nt went outside, because the while group decided to leave the bar and go somewhere else. \n\nThe next evening we had a big fight (we got other some issues right now) and at some point I said: \" You are moving fourther and further away from me emotionally and I just cant explain it, I am starting to think you have an affair or something. He denied that and later, when we both lay arm in arm together he said: \" I don't have an affair with Tina, she just likes me,thats why I am doing so much with her\" . I froze, I never mentioned her Name in anyway with any hint of jealousy, and always was extremly friendly with her. So why would he instantly say her Name?\n\nI have no Idea if I am just overreacting, or if there is a chance that he has a crush on her. If yes, how do I proceed? Confront him?

If any of you know if it is a cult or not, please do tell me as I'm not entirely sure. \n\nI personally have no problem with her joining clubs and such and am happy she has found a group of friends. However, she has become totally obsessed with it. She would spend hours every day doing what they (the club) call \"\u592a\u9633\u5fc3\u6cd5\" which is a kind of meditation (i think). Of course, I am again fine with this. \n\nThis \"club\" claims that the leader (they call him the mentor) has superpowers, and is someone sent from the Gods. My mother has spent days and weeks and months telling me that this \"mentor\" has the ability to foresee the future, and she truly believes everything he says. For instance, she has said that this mentor had previously stopped a tornado from hitting a town, has cured multiple people's cancer, etc. (including claiming that he's not from Earth but is an alien lol) \n\nThis \"club\" basically believes that if you continue doing this ritual you will reach a level where you're not human but somehwat close to a deity. She has repeatedly said that people who have joined this club has had huge monetay gains, health improvements etc. (which at this point sounds like a fraud to me) \n\nThere are many other things I have missed out on. But the most ridiculous things she has told me based on the \"club's\" teachings are: \n1. everyone suffering in this life is because they have done something wrong in their past lives and have to deeply reflect on themselves (despite not knowing what wrongs they gave committed lol) \n2. she knows that i am planning to study psychology. she has told me that there is no need for therapists / psychologists because people who are depressed went to their 'club' and after carrying out their rituals, they have become \"fine\".\n3. I have done fairly well on my most recent examination because I have studied hard. She claims that I have done well because she has joined this club. \n\nShe basically urges everyone she knows to join this club, even going as far as approaching random strangers to ask them to join. She brought me to get my haircut and she tried to convince my hairstylist to join. She has phoned everyone on her contact list day after day to urge them to join. Her reason for them to join is that \"she is helping others, its a very good club\", but whenever i ask what good has it brought to her, she claims that her \"negative energy\" is too strong and therefore she still has to carry out more rituals before her life changes. \n\nNeedless to say, as her daughter, she is trying to convince me to join as well. Even after I have clearly told her I would never join on numerous occasions, she is still trying to encourage me. \n\nMy family is not well-off. We are are a middle-class family and my father still has a lot of debt due to a past mistake but my mother has spent thousands to attend \"talks\", \"classes\" to \"level up\" their souls, concerts held by this club. She has even bought a whole box of books written by Ted Sun to distribute to random strangers and the books arent cheap. \n\nIn an attempt to stop her from convincing me to join, I have stopped talking to her whenever she brings this topic up (which is everyday). I basically wear my earphones and ignore her. But I really do want to go back to the days where she has not joined this club and talk to her about normal things again, like how's your day. \n\nIt's really frustrating and I've begun to resent her actions even though I really shouldn't.

I guess it's important to mention that she didn't like it when I ended things with Luke, since she thought that we were perfect for each other (she didn't really know much about the abuse, though, as we're not that close). I tried to explain in to her many times later, though. She didn't really like it when I started dating Peter only a few weeks later.\n\nWell, this summer, my friend group and I decided to book a beach vacation and I invited Christie along. All was mostly well until I asked them if Peter could join us for a day or two. Everyone excitedly approved, though I could see that Christie wasn't very happy about it. Well, Peter joins us, and we have a blast. I tried so hard to make Christie feel comfortable and for a moment it seemed to be working, until the day we decided to go swimming together. We were all goofing around, and Peter sunk my head under the water and held me like that for a few seconds. Christie freaked out and attacked him, after which he apologized and started freaking out too, thinking he was hurting me. He wasn't, I can swim and it was just harmless fun. Christie, however, told him he was a horrible person, and even though my friends and I tried to calm her down, it didn't seem to work. Peter felt really bad about it for quite some time. She would also freak out whenever he said anything offensive to me or my friends (it's just the way we joke) and at the end of the vacation, she told me she found him very rude and insensitive.\n\nWell, ever since we came home, she's been telling people about my new abusive boyfriend. My friends hate her. I tried to reason with her many times, but she won't change her opinion about him. I stopped hanging out with her, and thought that was the end of it, until my mom asked me if everything was okay with Peter and I. Apparently, Christie told her that he was trying to drown me while we were at the beach, and it got my mom worried. I left her an angry voicemail telling her to stop spreading lies about my boyfriend, as well as that it wasn't my, or anyone else's fault, that she lacks a sense of humor and that she's so stuck up. She replied with a heartfelt message saying she was simply worried about me and didn't want me to be abused. She also told me to think about getting back together with Luke, as he would never \"disrespect me like that\".\n\nI'm losing my mind here and don't know what to do. My friends can't stand her and Peter feels quite bad about the whole thing.

I doubted on answer and when I did I waited 10 sec to see if she would stay on line, she did.\n\nBasically, I ask where if everything was Ok, if anything was wrong, if something happened etc. She said no, everything was fine, she just wanted to talk, and we did, for about 20 min. We talked about movies, museums, and a project of her's.\n\nEverything was kinda ok, even tho I knew talking to her was wrong and so 2 things happened:\n\n1) When I heard her sister on the background and asked about her, she told me there was a story and the she would tell me later, as in another call. For me this was a quick though on my mind of \"Hmm no there will be no later, I need to close this now\"\n\n2) Right after she said she would tell me later her nephew of 5 went to her and asked a few things, while this happened I was gathering strength to say some of the hardest word I have ever said \"I need to you to stop calling me, you broke my heart and this is not ok, call me unless you really need it or something happened...\"\n\nBefore I could say it and before the nephew left her, he took the phone and said \"Hi boyfriend\". That shit hurt. \n\nShe took the phone and tried to continue like nothing happened. I ask her if he had introduce him to her family. She said yes. I took 3 years for me meet them. I ask her why it took so long in my case. She said \"Are we really gonna talk about this?\". I ask her if she really like him that much. And she said yes, that she really likes him.\n\nI said some words that until a week ago I never thought I would, not to her. She didn't even let me said she broke my heart, all I could said was \"Please, I need you to stop calling me. You...\" When she said \"Ok\" and hung up on me.\n\nAnd that was it, that's how a 6 years relationship where I knew she wanted a Vera Wang for her wedding, what ring she wanted and where she wanted to live, ended.\n\nTldr; she called me again, I asked to not call me again and before I could finish she interrupted me saying \"Ok\" and hugging up on me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2118407, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[UPDATE] Ex-gf [25] call me [27M] to say she's unhappy with life, work and NEW BF after she ghosted me for 1 1/2 month before broking up with me via email 4 months ago.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572090022, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dijmsh/update_exgf_25_call_me_27m_to_say_shes_unhappy/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mistync", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3p2rvzyd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571197236, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dijkng/boyfriend_dumped_me_the_day_of_my_dads_funeral/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dijkng", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 92, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dijkng/boyfriend_dumped_me_the_day_of_my_dads_funeral/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571197237, "score": 275, "selftext": "My father died suddenly last week and my boyfriend told me he didn\u2019t love me and couldn\u2019t see himself marrying me after the service.\n\nAppreciate the honest but what is wrong with someone who says such a hurtful thing on such a terrible day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2118394, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Boyfriend dumped me the day of my dads funeral", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572089689, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dijkng/boyfriend_dumped_me_the_day_of_my_dads_funeral/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "11throwaway98", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4s72k867", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571188637, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dihu1z/guy_30m_i_21f_just_started_seeing_told_me_i_could/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dihu1z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 437, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dihu1z/guy_30m_i_21f_just_started_seeing_told_me_i_could/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571188639, "score": 463, "selftext": "So I'm 5'8 140 pounds.

Well I ended up going through with it, 7 days ago my birthday arrived and as expected no one remembered apart from my friends, this was more or less the final push I needed to truly go through with it, however one thing changed in my plans largely due to the advice I had gotten, I chose to inform a select few of my really close friends about what I was about to do as I felt they deserved to know and I informed them I would contact them the moment I got a new phone, a lot of tears were shed, a lot of hugging ensued, a lot of attempts to get me to stay were made, but at the end of it all they understood why I had to go. I waited until evening to ensure my parents were in their booze ridden slumber and would likely not realize I was gone until the next day. I had informed the Police about my plans, I left the note I made for them and at this point I just grabbed all the belongings I had packed and left.\n\nWell after my long bus ride I arrived where I had planned on going and checked in to my motel and honestly I just cried for several hours, I felt relieved yet so alone, I was finally free in a sense. At that point I opened my laptop and send the E-mails I had prepared for everyone and just slept for hours upon hours as I was just utterly exhausted from the travel and from the tense nervous feeling I had been enduring for the past few days. \n\nWell I wont go in to too much details about the rest of the days there, but I more or less went ahead and started looking for an apartment to rent and informed my soon to be boss that I was excited to start working for him, more or less to confirm it all so I would know ahead of time if he no longer needed me and I needed to get a new job quick. Well he confirmed he was looking forward to seeing me as well, so I guess I will start my new job in a few days. As for the apartment hunt, I sort of got lucky and found something nice yet cheap so I am going to see the place tomorrow and hopefully move in within the next few days(If it is up to par) as frankly I can't wait to get out of this stuffy motel room and make my own home, I also opened a new bank account and got a new phone and all of that for those who were worried about my money and so forth.\n\nHowever by far the best thing that happened in these last few days was the e-mail I got from my sister, like I said I sent all my siblings and my parents an e-mail detailing why I was leaving and of course some personal attachments as to the influence they had on my life. Well my sister replied to it and I don't think I have ever been happier in my life.\n\nTo avoid going in to too much detail she sent me a long-long e-mail explaining why she had been keeping her distance, saying she was happy that I made this decision and she begged me to please keep in contact with her as she wanted me in her life, in fact she even offered to come get me and let me move in with her and her boyfriend, which I declined as I feel I need to do this on my own and frankly I am sort of scared of relying on anyone related to me.\n\nI also went ahead and added all of my good friends on my new phone and contacted the ones I had told to tell them I was okay and the ones I had not told to inform them about what happened, shortly after this I got a message from the parents of my close friend Tanya(Fake name obviously) who stated if they had known I would have been more then welcome to stay at their home and should I ever want to their door was open added to that they said if I needed anything to not hesitate to ask them, which honestly just made me feel so good, sort of made me feel loved for the first time in a long-long time. I also ended up messaging Tanya a lot and in turns out she has had feelings for me for a long time...I sort of wish I knew that a long time ago, but we can't have it all you know! Especially not if you are me, I am rarely lucky.\n\nBut all in all, I am doing really well, if my useless parents prepared me for anything, it is for living on my own and taking care of myself by the fact they are useless, I always had to do it anyways but now I am actually doing it for myself, because I want to do it, not because I have to do it.\n\nI want to thank everyone who commented and messaged for their support and advice, it honestly pushed me to take this last step and sort of ensured I took some extra measures that probably helped me in the long run. I never really knew there were so many nice people in the world, but it seems there are...At any rate thanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2117067, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update: I am going to leave my family, go no contact with all of them and start over, I could use any and all input/advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572084165, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/didoai/update_i_am_going_to_leave_my_family_go_no/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRA_cricso", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4syzdmkc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571168353, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/did5cd/i_25m_snooped_on_my_gfs_24f_phone_what_i_found/", "gildings": {}, "id": "did5cd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 347, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/did5cd/i_25m_snooped_on_my_gfs_24f_phone_what_i_found/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571168550, "score": 931, "selftext": "I'll keep it short. I've known this girl a long time, we were really close friends for a few years and started dating around 2 years ago. For the most part our relationship has been pretty much perfect... until a few weeks back. A few weeks ago this guy I knew back in high school (24M) moved into town so I invited him to hang out. My gf wanted to come along too since she had nothing better to do that night which is fine, I'm happy to have her with me. They hit it off really well - almost too well, but I didn't think anything of it because I trust her and also this guy has a girlfriend he's been with a lot longer than I've been with mine. She gave him her number which made me kind of nervous (she's never done that with any of my friends before - if they exchange contacts it's because the friend asked, not her) but again, I had no reason to distrust her so I just let it be.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, and she keeps talking about him every now and then even though we haven't hung out with him since that first time... I know I shouldn't be invading my gf's privacy but I was starting to get a bad feeling in my gut something's happening, and reading the messages between them confirmed that completely. It was pretty clear looking at the messages that 1) They've been hooking up for a while... STARTING LITERALLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FIRST MEETING and 2) He makes no effort to even talk to her like a human being, gives her one word replies or even just ignores her when she's trying to have a conversation and just asks her to come over or meet him somewhere every now and then. He's basically using her like a sex toy and she seems to be completely OK with that.\n\nThis guy is objectively pretty traditionally attractive, he's tall and muscular while I'm average height and on the skinny side.  My gf always made it sounds like she's into how I look but clearly that was a lie. I've always been a little insecure about my looks/attractiveness and this is just destroying me. Getting cheated on is bad enough, but to make things worse I *really* had to work for it and make sincere effort while this guy is just treating her like a cum dump and she can't seem to get enough of it?? Even though we've only been together the last 2 years I've had a crush on her pretty much ever since I first met her, and in every way this relationship seemed perfect. I honestly can't imagine life without her even though I know the smart thing to do is probably to end things. I don't know if I can forgive her for this, and I don't know if I want to.

And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect. \n\n\nMom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you\u2014\n\n\nMe: No. This is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. \n\n\nMom: Fine. I\u2019m just happy I finally get to meet her. \n\n\nDad: *Insulting weight related comment*\n\n\nMe: What the fuck dad? \n\n\nMom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can\u2019t be that bad. \n\n\nMe: No if there\u2019s any chance of that sort of commentary, I\u2019ll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You\u2019re going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won\u2019t get the chance to screw it up. \n\n\nDad: *Insulting joke* \n\n\n\nMe: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you\u2019ve heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. \n\n\n\nMom: No, wait, I\u2019ll make sure his act is together by the time you\u2019re out here. \n\n\nDad: *Insulting comment* \n\n\n\nMe: I\u2019m hanging up. \n\n\nSo it looks like I\u2019m going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said \u201cIt would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won\u2019t be possible and it definitely isn\u2019t worth putting you through this.\u201d\n\nSo thanks for the comments and help.

I made the post roughly a week and a half ago and frankly it's been a long week and a half. Very long. I took into consideration what all of you had advised me to do. Cameras, pepper sprays, tell my very pregnant mum, move out, door lock and point blank confrontation. I decided that out of all of them, even though it would be the riskiest of them all, would be to tell my mom. She did not take this well. At first she claimed that I was lying, which was expected and told me to come with proof, which was also expected, but at this point, it would be MY word, her daughter, against his. She was mad furious when I told her. I didn't want it getting to her at all because of her condition, but it did. She had an anxiety attack after confronting him about what I said and he  blamed me for what had happened saying that if anything had happened to the baby, he would never forgive me. I was appalled. When she finally felt better after getting some medical attention, we all had a sit down and she was very hands on with the situation. Prior to this, I had explained to her that her happiness is my first priority and I wouldn't do anything to sabotage it. I'm glad she understood. Because she believed me. He however kept on denying the claims and yet again my mom backed me up. They've since \"taken a break\" and my mom doesn't want us crossing paths. He's back at his home town while I'm with her and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm enrolling for therapy soon because I still feel violated and I want to be free from this pain. She mentioned that she wasn't going to let the baby grow up without knowing the father but there's going to be eyes on him every step of the way. I'm grateful for all of the pieces of advice that all 900 of you gave me. I'm also really grateful for sharing with me your similar cases and how best to protect myself from now on. Thank you all.

He has no control over when he is going to have to go and when he does have to go it is always an emergency and a panic to find the nearest bathroom. I don't remember this being such an issue in our first year of being together but it has became increasingly problematic.\n\nFrom what I can remember this first began to be an issue on road trips. We would pack up the car, use the bathroom and be on our way. After about 10 minutes of driving it would always be \"We need to find a bathroom now!\" \"Pull off the highway now!\" This occured even more often when my family dog was in the car, she shakes during car rides and he claimed that her anxiety caused him to have to shit.... even on 20-30 minutes drives we have to stop once or twice on the regular now.\n\nThen it started to happen more frequently at restaurants. We would go out for a nice meal or date night and not too long after we ordered he would be in the bathroom, sometimes not coming out until 20 minutes after our food has been delivered. It was kind of a running joke at first that I would tell our friends it's almost like I'm going out to eat alone, but it is so bad now that I have eaten several meals by myself, often boxing his food and leaving once he is done in the bathroom.\n\nHis most recent trigger is grocery stores. If we are going to the store together I have no doubt that he will have to poop. It isn't a big deal if it is at the begining because I can shop while he is in the bathroom and then meet him at the checkout, but when we are about to leave and he suddenly has to go I will have to just wander around the store for 20 minutes. I've been left alone for so long I often contemplate buying ridiculous appliances because I have nothing better to do than weave in and out of the isles. \n\nHonestly it is to the point now that we can not do any activity where there might not be a bathroom. Went to an outdoor coffee shop and almost had to leave the other day, went wine tasting at a cider mill the other day and I sat alone at the bar for 30 minutes while he went searching for a bathroom, and the bartender could not continue to the tasting until he returned. We are late to family and friends events because he will suddenly have to go as we are about to leave, often making us 20 to 30 minutes late. The fact that every single place we go I have to be worried about whether or not he suddenly have an emergency gives me a lot of anxiety. \n\nI am also at the point where I have no more sympathy for him. I've been telling him for about a year that he should see a doctor because this is extremely abnormal. I have zero sympathy for him is he refuses to try and help himself. I beg with him that if he isn't going to do it for himself then do it for me because I hate that we have to plan our lives around the possibility that he may shit his pants. He then tells me that I'm not being reasonable.\n\nHe makes several excuses for not seeing a doctor such as \"what if there is nothing they can do\" and \"what if it is just who I am\". I always come back saying that if it is something untreatable then I would be 100 times more understanding and sypathetic but it is best to just know. I don't understand why he wouldnt want this resolved if it is possible!?\n\nI love him and this is something that I can deal with but I don't want to if I don't have to. I just want to go on a date where he eats his meal with me or go to a festival or event where I don't have to worry about where the nearest toilet is and how long the lines will be. \n\nTL:DR My boyfriend has to poop all the time, often leaving me alone at restaurants for entire dinners. We plan our lives around the possibility that he might poop his pants. He refuses to see a doctor.

When my birth father (BF from this point forward) left, his brother and his wife (who I will refer to as my parents) adopted me. According to my mom who was very close with my birth mom, she passed away from what she told me was due to complications related with Parkinson's. while she was sick in a hospital in Reno, BF went AWOL. Just up and left. BM passed away while I was home with the neighbor. Eventually with BF gone and no word from him they had to declare a guardian for me. BF and BM had my parents in both of their wills as godparents. Essentially BF was written off as a case of parental abandonment.  \n\n My parents were my legal guardians and the eventually took the extra step and adopted me. That was about the time I turned 2.  Dads brother (BF) just calls him up out of the blue from some place in Arizona like nothing happened. Doesn't even ask about me. My dad tries to bring me up because of course that's why he calling, why else would he dare to call almost 2 years later? My dad being the gentle and thoughtful guy that he was bring me up and even gives his brother the option to have visitations with me. He passes. Has no interest in visit. Just wanted to see how his *brothers* doing. Not me the baby he left with the dying mother. That was my my mom's breaking point. She said that he wasn't welcomed if he ever dared to step foot in their home let alone the state of Nevada. That was that. I rarely heard his name growing up and don't remember any of that stuff that happened as a baby.\n\nNow in present day life. My dad passed away 4 years ago September 11, 2015. From a long long battle with COPD more specifically Emphysema. I have healed and think of him fondly at this point and have more good thoughts then sad when he crosses my mind. But his death was the most agonizing thing I've done in this life it has been a long road to get to the other side of grief. Then Friday morning I get this message right when I wake up from facebook.\n\n\"Hi I'm *your BF* from Peoria Arizona im looking for my daughter *TheDezPez* are you from Nevada  or have you lived there when you were a baby.  Please text me if you're My baby girl who I'm looking for.\"\n\nThis just opened up all these wounds and has sent me into a tale spin all weekend and it just keeps going. I want to answer him and talk to him, but I absolutely do not need another dad. I have made my peace without one. Plus I don't appreciate  him disappearing for 25 years and then thinking he can come back thinking he can call me baby girl. I just want to understand my family history that's literally the only reason I want to answer him. Also slightly curious how he hunted me down.

I can't believe that after 7 years I have to make this post. Going to keep it vague because I'm too lazy to type out the whole conversation but basically we were talking about sex and she just comes out with it: 'I miss feeling full'. I immediately cut off the chat, went to my games room and basically just ignored her for the day. The next day I apologized for overreacting before we both left for work but over the day at work it was grinding at me so badly and it's left a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\n\nOur wedding date is set as March 17th but\u00a0 I don't want to go through with it. But everyone I know who I've spoken to about this is telling me that I'm overreacting and that I have no grounds to call off the wedding over this. Basically being berated by half of them. OK, so I get it, I'm not allowed to call it off. I'll do it if people just leave me the fuck alone about it. I'm happy to just cruise along if 1. People stop giving me shit for it and 2. If she doesn't expect me to want to have sex with her, she can fuck someone else as long as I don't have to hear about it aswell.\n\n\nShe keeps saying sorry and that she didn't mean anything by it but I don't know... It just isn't registering that she's actually sorry and I feel like she's only sorry that she's getting reduced attention and not sorry because I'm hurt by it, because she should have surely known that that's just a straight up insult. She says she doesn't want anyone else but that's not what she was saying when she basically just told me that she wanted a bigger dick again, so whatever it's not sincere. And I'm willimg to bet if I told her I needed one of those pocket pussy things to enjoy sex more then she'd have had a hissy fit. I don't know what the fuck to do I'm just getting battered from all sides and I can't take it much longer. I just need tips on how I can make this blow over so I can just coast and stop being harrassed about it.

Tonight just sealed the deal when he pushed me too far and now I don\u2019t know what to do. Help.\n\nSo, I got to work at around 4:10pm. Started my shift at 4:30. Not too long afterwards I get a text from my significant other about a receipt he magically found just sitting in front of him, waiting for him to discover it from MONTHS ago. The receipt is for a bottle of wine and a small thing of scotch. He went on a huge tangent about how I lied to him about it, I must be lying to him or my ex has been coming over while he is at work. I have had him throw this accusation at me multiple times. I had to cut back on my friendships because every guy who messaged me on social media or he sees talking to me is immediately one of my secret boyfriends.\n\nAnyways, I told him I already explained everything to him. But, he wants a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d answer. I explained to him that he comes after me almost weekly as of late with problems that can only be resolved by a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. It just goes around in a circle. I have asked him multiple times to stop with the witch-hunt. What I do with my money is what I do with my extra cash, I will do with my extra cash. Just because he doesn\u2019t see what happened doesn\u2019t mean it is a lie. He just prefer to hear there answer he wants to.\n\nToday was the same shit, different day. He was kind enough to let me go almost a full weekend without him discovering something \u201caccidentally\u201d while \u201ccleaning\u201d. The man has garbage mountain beside his bedside table and under his side of the bed (the cat even move through it) because of all the shit he stuffs under there that he doesn\u2019t think I know about or just doesn\u2019t care for me to know about. His bottles of booze, his empty pizza boxes, cups, bottles, cigarettes, used condoms (not from our relationship), etc. Yet today, of all days, a piece of paper for a receipt with a bottle of wine and a small thing of liquor, totalling under $30, from months ago was with my blanket on the couch. The same blanket I had been sitting on before I left for work. There is no way his stoner ass decided to randomly tidy up my space. He is off of work and already \u201ccleaned\u201d the apartment last week. I digress, slightly.\n\n\nIn that moment it became a \u201ceither you are cheating on me or you are lying to me\u201d which erupted into me having to work for seven hours while people yelled at me for things I have no control over while he is accusing me and sending angry texts. I turned off my phone and just went back to work. Bussed it home. Came in around 12:20 am. I was still upset with him so I went for a walk around the block, maybe three minutes, to try and calm down my anger and anxiety since I was getting the weird cold hands, sweaty palms thing from my anxiety\u2019s fight or flight response. When I got back he was standing outside asking me where I went. I said \u201ca walk\u201d and he asked me why. I told him to get some air. He asked why again and I snapped and said \u201cbecause it is something I have the capability to do and I had the desire to do so\u201d. All the way up the staircase it was \u201cwhy\u201d to everything I said so I snapped and said \u201cyou are not five years old. Just because it isn\u2019t a response you don\u2019t like doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a response to your question\u201d.\n\n\nThis went on until we got back into the apartment. He started attacking me. Just accusing me of lying and cheating because he found a receipt from months ago with a bottle of wine and a small bottle of liquor. This is where it hit the point of no return for me. Eventually I snapped because he was doing the same thing he always does: ignores what I am saying and continues to pester me. Just like this morning when I turned him down for sex because I woke up feeling really anxious and wasn\u2019t in the mood. Did that stop him? Nope. Just kept grabbing at me, smacking my ass, joking around, and just ignoring my constant requests to leave me alone. His excuse \u201cI am pretty sure you said at once point that even if you say \u2018no\u2019 that you still want it and should go ahead with it anyways\u201d. I may have said that in passing as a joke, but as someone who has been sexually assaulted I can almost guarantee I wouldn\u2019t say \u201ceven if I say \u2018no\u2019, you should still force me to have sex with you\u201d.\n\n\nI screamed at the top of my lungs as hard as I could for him to leave me alone. His response was to come over, grab me by the wrists, then, while holding my wrists, tell me that I am going to give him a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. I told him to get his hands off of me and leave this room. Just kept repeating that. He just kept going on. He went into the bedroom, came back out, then rehashed his attack on me. I told him he has been through my stuff already (he denied it, but it is clear that he has trust issues with me), but he can go through it again right now. Look for all the bottles of booze I am apparently hiding from him or he can search the entire apartment for my ex. He could even rig up a camera. Do whatever the fuck he wants to just leave me alone.\n\n\nSo now, here I am. Stuck in an apartment with a partner with an EXPLOSIVE behaviour who accuses me of doing something wrong almost every week. This week I am finally done. I want to move out, but I have no friends or family to move in with. I am stuck with him until I can either leave or he kicks me out. I have no idea what to do. He has anger issues and he is likely going to go too far when that happens. I don\u2019t want kids with someone who can flip that quickly. I just, am failing to see why I should stick around. He obviously doesn\u2019t \u201clove\u201d me.

It got worse. So bad that while I was taking A&amp;P over Summer I he called me the morning before an exam (I was extremely stressed as it was the unit I had studied least) and proceeded to chew my ass for accidentally taking both keys to the second car because I was so distracted demanding that I drive home to give him one. Now, my class was only 2 hours long...and there was plenty of food in the house. He wanted doughnuts for the 4th day in a row. \n\nHe pulled his motorcycle into the living room and left it for three weeks while we had a toddler in the house. He lied about money so much that I couldn\u2019t buy groceries for 3 weeks, a coworker made a donation to my education, and our CC\u2019s were maxed out....but he spent 350$ on a watch, then another 300$ on a leather jacket that he hid from me.     That month and a half is what finally did it. \n\nHe called me worthless, a bad mother, threatened to take my daughter from me, then demanded that I leave. So...I did. He went to work, I told him I would be at my grandparents, and I packed the house and left. It\u2019s been two months. I don\u2019t miss him. I miss my life, my home, my friends...but not him.

Went about my Thanksgiving weekend with my family and gave her her space with her girlfriend out of town.  \n\nIt did still linger as a question mark in the back of my mind throughout the weekend, by generally I was pretty able to put it aside until I had a chance to chat with her face to face.  We also texted intermittently throughout the weekend and exchanged photos. I let her take the lead in that regard, and mostly just responded whenever she hit me up.  She sent me a selfie of her and her girlfriend hanging out too, so that was nice.\n\nI picked her up at the airport a couple hours ago and we exchanged stories of our respective weekends, laughed and generally had some nice light conversation on the way back.  I had no indication from her of a looking elephant in the room, and even got the sense that she'd completely forgotten about the brief conversation regarding  'Sexy Ryan' from a few days earlier.  \n\nWhen we pulled into our parking space she went to get out and I told her to hand on a sec and that I wanted to talk to her about something.  She seemed confused. So I told her that I was still confused myself and that I needed her to help me understand why that device was one of just four in her list, including mine, hers and her roommate's.  She just laughed and went to her phone, then handed me an open conversation between her and Sarah (the carpool buddy) from minutes after our call that morning that went something like this:\n\nGF: 'OMG, my bf is driving back home in my car and just called to ask who Ryan is \ud83d\ude02'\n\nSarah: 'Haaaaahaha. NO WAY!  And I bet he was wondering why Ryan is so SEXY. Lolol'\n\nGF: 'Seriously. You need to change your phone name girl.'\n\nSarah: 'Ok ok. But you have to admit that pretty funny \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02'\n\nAnyway, I think I played it pretty cool and she was a good sport about it too.  And well.. I get to keep my 3 year relationship with the woman I love, so there's that.  We also talked about some of the other stuff regarding sex life and future talk, and she seemed a little surprised there too.  Seems it really was just a case of life getting busy and stress mounting up.\n\nThanks for all the advice everyone, whether it was more optimistic or a little more leaning toward doom and gloom.

To my surprise this time it didn't take long because she just burst into tears. She reassured me that everything was fine between us but there was an issue with her parents and I wasn't supposed to know from her but she is very angry at her father and this was how the issue between us came to be.\n\nHer father is having an affair, has been seeing this woman for 10 months. Anne's mother had no idea something was up until he said he was going out with me for a beer and then later Anne sent a picture of me and her at a party that same night. \n\nThen, he went out twice to meet up with me for a beer which was weird (we only went out once a month) but he told her I was helping him out with an idea for a project he had for their house. Since at this point she was suspicious she started to check with Anne whenever he said he was going out with me.\n\nThings started to get more obvious and Anne's father ended up coming clean a few weeks ago. They broke the news to their sons and daughters but had a special talk with Anne since her father had been using my name in this mess and her mother thought it was only right for him to talk to me and apologize.

I said I didnt know because I've never been with a girl that had them.\n\nThen she sent me about five different pictures of her boobs and asked me if they would look good with piercings on them. I said \"sure why not.\" Then she asked me if I found them attractive myself. And I said her boobs were aesthetic enough to pull them off. Then she asked if I found her attractive, and said she found me attractive. In an attempt to not criminalize myself, I said \"it doesnt matter what i think, what matters is what your husband, my best friend, thinks.\" Then she said he didnt mind us having this conversation because I was such a good friend to them, and he's not jealous at all.  And she concluded with \"I'm sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable, but you're one of my best friends and I trust your judgement and I can be very open with you with anything.\" I didnt tell her husband anything because she said that it was a surprise for him, and I didnt want to ruin it.\n\nThat in a vaccum would he alright, here's what is messing me up.

After his failed attempt, he sold a bunch of his wife\u2019s and kid\u2019s possessions along with all of his work tools for his next fix. Once he was confronted about this, he rushed into his son\u2019s bedroom and stole $300 I had given to my girlfriend\u2019s little brother, bolted out the door and drove away in his work van. The cops were immediately alerted with his name, make of car, license plate number and my girlfriend\u2019s family explained that he could be a danger to himself and others since he\u2019s most likely tweaked out while driving. Yet the police have been useless through all of this. My girlfriend\u2019s mother even has a tracker on his phone and notified the police of his location yet the police still haven\u2019t done a goddamn thing. \n\nThis event seems to have been a tipping point for my girlfriend\u2019s family. They kicked him out of the house and told him that, if he won\u2019t willing go to rehab, he either needs to be in jail or psych-hold because he\u2019s not welcome at home. He was MIA for quite awhile however he eventually got in touch with my girlfriend. He played dumb like nothing happened and even asked her for money. Obviously she said no and that everyone knows what he\u2019s up to yet everyone still wants to help him out but he has to make thar decision for himself because no one can force him to want to be sober. That call ended with him apologizing and acknowledging that he needs help however my girlfriend\u2019s mother could see on her tracker that he is still going to his usual \u201cpick up\u201d spots on a daily basis. \n\nJust yesterday my girlfriend\u2019s father called her again, seriously crying this time, saying that he has cleared out his van and that it will be left outside the house on Tuesday and that there will be letters in there for each kid and their mom. He ended the call by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have a plan and you won\u2019t have to worry about me anymore.\u201d\n\nAlthough my girlfriend\u2019s family is estranged by this whole ordeal, none of them (including me) want to see his life ended... But we can\u2019t force him into rehab and like I said before, the cops have been useless and we don\u2019t know who else to turn to. It feels like this will be the time where he is going to end it all and we don\u2019t know how to stop this train.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2114297, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [27M] girlfriend\u2019s [24F] father [50M] is most likely going to kill himself this week.

They made me get over my fear of public speaking, and face my fear of embarrassing myself in front of people. I used to be very socially anxious and they did loads for my social skills and confidence. So when I have part time job interviews or school presentations now, I am very confident and comfortable.\n\nI also enjoy the fashion side of it, fashion and makeup is a passion of mine. But recently I've been kind of fed up with how restrictive the pageants I do are about what is acceptable to wear; I'm more into experimental runway style stuff recently.\n\nAnyway, this year my family has been taking a lot about college, about financing it specifically. My parents have a small college fund for me but it won't cover everything. I'll be applying for grants and scholarships and loans to cover a lot of it; and I'll be the one paying the loans back after graduation. Depending on where I study, how much my parents contribute, what kind of grants and scholarships I get, and what kind of loans I get... I could end up with a lot of debt. Debt scares me because I've seen some friends' families get really deep in that hole.\n\nI want to get into a STEM field, I'm thinking I'm interested in Computer Science, so I hopefully will be able to pay them down, but still, debt stresses me out.\n\nRecently, I've also been trying to learn about finances and budgeting and investing too, because in a few years I'll need to handle my own money. I already am doing that a little because I had a job this summer at a day camp. \n\nAnd while learning about money, my parents have showed me a lot about how they budget, the tools and spreadsheets they use. About saving up for something over time, about investment and retirement savings. Basically every part of their budget. \n\nAnd it was really surprising to see how much money was going towards pageants. Like I knew it was expensive, but putting it in comparison to the mortgage and car payments, to what tuition would cost... It really put things in proportion to me. Like, it's been a passion of mine, but is it really worth all that? The cost of dresses, hair, shoes, makeup, dance lessons, flights, hotels, pageant fees, tanning, etc. It was a lot, and it could make a huge dent in the cost of college. \n\nSo I told my parents that I wanted to stop pageants for my last two years of high school, and put all the money that was budgeted for them, towards a college fund. \n\nI thought that would be a reasonable thing to ask for; it was money they wanted to spend on me anyway, and I think that asking for college money is like the most responsible thing I could do. \n\nAnd it didn't go well.\n\nMy mom thinks I'm overreacting, giving up on something I love because I'm stressing about money even though I'm too young to really understand it. \n\nMy dad says they were happy to spend on my dream, and that we can make pageants and college work. But I know money doesn't grow in trees, you spend it on one thing and there's less for other things. That's just how it is. \n\nMy mom keeps talking about the pageant I was going to do this year, a new one I can do now that I'm 16, it's a big deal. And how it's something to bond over as a family; something we were all looking forward to. And how I should think more before giving it up. \n\nMy mom also told me that it's not my money, I can't just decide where it goes if I decide to not do pageants.\n\nIs there any way I could convince them?\n\nTLDR - I want to stop doing beauty pageants, and save the money for college.

My parents had me very young, fresh out of secondary school, and though they were never really \"together\" have always been good friends and co parented me well. When I was 10, my dad met a new lady and has been in a relationship with her ever since. He proposed to her three months ago. \n\nI've always got the feeling that my stepmother to be doesn't like me. She's very standoffish and distant. She refers to my bedroom in their house as a guest room, despite the fact it's full of my things, I'm there 50% of the time and they have an entirely seperate bedroom they give to overnight guests. She doesn't refer to me by name when talking about me with other people, just \"(dads name)'s son\" or \"your son\" if she's talking to my dad. She's deliberately planned family holidays without me and for the past four years has insisted I stay at mum's house for Christmas, instead of mum and dad taking turns having me stay like normal. All this to say, she's made it very apparent she considers me more a somewhat annoying regular houseguest than  a member of the family. \n\nThere are five of us kids in total; myself and her 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, then she and dad have 5 year old twin boys and a one year old daughter. I get on very well with the kids. It's just their mum who doesn't like me. \n\nSo, the wedding. Last week I was at their place and they were discussing the roles of the kids in the wedding. 13yo is gonna be a bridesmaid. Twins are gonna be ringbearers. Baby is gonna be a flowergirl. I didn't get mentioned, so I asked what role I'm getting and they tell me I'm not, they want the focus on the younger kids for the aww factor. That was fine, until I found out that she has three other bridesmaids who are all adults, and all of my dad's groomsmen are adults too. \n\nI'm really really upset. I've felt for a long time that my dad loves the others more than me and this confirms it as far as I'm concerned. Not ashamed to admit I cried for a good 20 minutes when I found out I was pretty much being pushed out deliberately. I'm seriously considering not going to the wedding at all, but mum thinks I should. She says she acknowledges it's unfair but refusing to go would damage my relationship with my dad forever and I don't want that either.

She said I was much smaller than she was expecting, which she didn't like. She said she felt much cuter, which was nice for a change. And she said I was pretty awkward. Then, after we had sex for the first time, she messaged the group chat that she \"low-key had to close her eyes.\"\n\nI realize my gf's friend probably shouldn't have done that.

At the beginning of the year my old roommate informed me that he was moving out to live with his girlfriend. I had to end up using a Facebook group to find a new roommate, who we will call Steve. Steve was sort of a stereotypical jock (I'm more in to video games and I don't workout so we didn't have much in common), but we had a perfectly cordial relationship. He was clean and respectful and we mostly stayed out of each other's way.\n\n\nIn hindsight this makes a lot more sense, but I did notice that Jen and Steve really seemed to get along well. They'd joke around a lot, but it was never to a point that I'd suspect anything. Sometimes Jen would stay over when I had to leave and I'd usually come home to her and Steve sitting on the couch just casually chatting. I never even thought twice about it to be honest.\n\n\nIn the last few months before we broke up, Jen had just seemed distant. We never had any huge fights, but I could just tell she wasn't into it. She ended up breaking up with me right after Labor Day.\u00a0\n\n\nNow this is where the story gets bad for me. About a week later she texted me and told me she wanted to tell me something. She told me that she had a crush on Steve and that they were going to hangout. She promised that she wouldn't be disrespectful by being around me, but obviously this still broke my heart.\u00a0\n\nLast weekend I left my room to go to the bathroom and was shocked to find Jen on the couch. I didn't know what to do so I pretty much just ran back into my room after I went to the bathroom. Later on I heard some noises from Steve's room that made me sick. I have never felt this heartbroken before and I really don't know what I should do.\n\n\nObviously this is a terrible living situation for my mental health, but I really can't afford to move right now and my closest family is ~1000 miles away. Should I try to talk to Steve to tell him how I feel or should I just keep it to myself and suck it up until the lease is over?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2113323, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (25M) recent ex (24F) started seeing my roommate", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572063063, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhrxd0/my_25m_recent_ex_24f_started_seeing_my_roommate/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "incognitosexadvice", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2u7kb6g0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571065270, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhrrdr/i_m36_hate_my_wifes_f36_haircut_and_its_making/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dhrrdr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 381, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhrrdr/i_m36_hate_my_wifes_f36_haircut_and_its_making/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1571065271, "score": 1056, "selftext": "I am fully aware of how shallow this makes me sound, but I\u2019m just having such a hard time overlooking it. I feel like a jerk. We have been married almost 12 years and have two kids, 4.5 and 1.5. \n\nAbout 7 months ago, my wife cut her hair pretty short. She told me she was considering it beforehand, and she had perfectly understandable reasons for it (easier to care for, harder for our youngest, who was nursing at the time, to pull on, etc.). She has long known that I don\u2019t find short hair on women attractive at all. I told her at the time that I would prefer she didn\u2019t, but that she is obviously free to do whatever she wants to her appearance. \n\nI have never specifically told her I don\u2019t like it, but she definitely knows. I was really hoping it would be a one and done thing, but she keeps getting it cut. I\u2019ve tried to make myself like it, but I just can\u2019t. I really, really hate it. I don\u2019t think it looks good on her at all, and it makes her look just like her mom, which creeps me out a little. \n\nI have tried very hard not to be critical. I have said things like \u201cWould you be open to growing it back out? I really miss your beautiful longer hair,\u201d etc. I don\u2019t know what else to say, and I know it would be hurtful if I said outright that I don\u2019t like it. I know she dislikes facial hair, so I made a point of not shaving for a while several months ago, and she was openly disdainful of that. I had to start shaving again for work reasons, though. I know it sounds stupid, but every trip back to the hairdresser feels like a little slap in the face. \n\nWe have had sex twice in the last calendar year.

He says mean stuff about their families, like how (name's) momma is on meth\n\n- Zach tried to go though my phone, look at personal texts with a boy I was dating, but luckily my phone was at 1 percent and died and i hid my charger\n\n- Zach is an aggressive driver and I won't go in his car\n\nAnyway, I told my school counselor all of that and i could tell she was very concerned. She asked about my diary, and I said I had more detail about all of this in my diary, I'd show her those pages if she wanted.\n\nShowing her the diary was easier than talking for me. So i was happy to.\n\nAnd after that, things went down hill. It seems like the councilor has the impression stuff is sexually motivated, but that's not how it is. And she's filed a report with cps, she said she had no choice because that's a law.\n\nWhen I was at home and Zach was yelling at me about something, I let it slip what I'd done. I told him to shut up because CPS was coming soon and he shouldn't be adding to the list of nasty stuff he'd said.\n\nHe got even madder and is planning on going to the school today to confront the principal. I'm not sure what will happen. Plus there's still the thing that the councilor seemed to misinterpret.. what can I do?\n\nTLDR - I am rely stressed after talking to s school councilor about my step dad.

We now have a baby and another on the way. My husband has always been adamant he wanted kids and I delayed because I wasn\u2019t sure, but now that we have a baby I am so happy and can\u2019t believe I waited this long. \n\nAbout a month ago my husband yelled at our baby and I cannot get over it. \n\nFor context - Our son was 8 months old and he started daycare about 2 months prior and has gone from one viral illness to the next. His sleep was poor before, but since being sick I have had to go back to a night feeding or two to keep him hydrated and sometimes he is just having a coughing fit or choking on mucous like anyone would and needs something to drink. The doctor says that I am doing everything right and doing great staying on top of things and it sucks, but eventually this will pass (my husband was present for this). \n\nDuring all of this my husband has two different dinners with two different male friends that I think were part of the problem and I am realizing how easily influenced my husband is by others. First dinner his friend has a child one year older than ours and she is a nightmare. She is spoiled by her mother and has tantrums CONSTANTLY over everything and they are honestly pretty miserable to be around now. Spineless friend 1 honestly doesn\u2019t help this situation, but that\u2019s another topic. First friend was venting to my husband about his nightmare child. My husband then has dinner with a second friend. Second friend has a baby about 3 months younger than ours. Second friend\u2019s baby is easy, has had almost no problems, and has been sleeping through the night for a couple of months already.\n\nNow a few nights after his second dinner I ask him in the middle of the night to take one of the baby wake ups. Honestly, I do probably 90+% of wake ups because he is gone more than half of the time anyways so me and the baby have a routine and i have to wake my husband up because the baby crying doesn\u2019t wake him. But this night I was sick too and I\u2019m pregnant and I just NEEDED some sleep pretty desperately so I asked him to take this one. He says, \u201cFine, but I am not doing a night feeding, because this is bullshit\u201d. Great start. I have also been weaning the baby back off night feedings, we were down to one, half bottle, but ok. Well thank god we have a baby monitor because he walks into that room, picks up our baby, and starts yelling \u201chush, hush your mouth, you shut up\u201d. \n\nWTF. I immediately shoot out of bed and go scoop our now screaming baby out of his hands. I said what is wrong with you? You are yelling at our baby. He said this was all ridiculous and he should be sleeping through the night so we should just put him back down and turn off the baby monitor so he is sleep trained. During this snot is pouring out of our baby\u2019s nose and he is coughing occasionally because he is still getting over being sick. Plus, we are screwing with his routine of a bottle. Right there I seriously considered kicking him out of the house. It wasn\u2019t just that he yelled at the baby instead of comforting his sick child, but that he saw absolutely nothing wrong with it. He also knows damn well that\u2019s not how you sleep train a baby. I told him to get out of the room and he said no he would handle this. There was no way in hell I was passing our son back to him. I held our baby for almost an hour while he settled down and back to sleep, during the first 20 minutes my husband sat in the room and scowled at us and then got up and left. If I had just gone in and comforted him and wiped his nose and given him that half of a bottle he would have been asleep in less than 15 minutes. \n\nI realized that this was all because of the dinners. My husband realized that our baby was developmentally supposed to be sleeping through the night like friend two\u2019s baby and he thought that we were spoiling our baby or something equally stupid like friend one\u2019s kid. After I got the baby down we had a screaming match, where again it took everything in me to not tell him to get out of the house, but I brought up what I thought and I think it registered some. But I still feel like he doesn\u2019t really think he did anything wrong and now I will never ask him to take another night wake up because I feel like I can\u2019t trust him. And we have a second baby on the way so this is not good. \n\nHe\u2019s had a history of other friends and family influencing his decisions, but before it was always things like what appliances we buy or what cell phone he should get, which is annoying, but not a baby and it seems to be getting worse. \n\nI am also really frustrated that he\u2019s so easily influenced by his friends.

I was and am always happy to join in: seeing my friends being surprised and happy makes me feel nice too.\n\nI never expect much for my birthday, but I did kinda expect some things to happen. I didn\u2019t care for a huge thing, maybe we go out to eat lunch together or whatever.\n\nBut nothing really happened. I got a couple gifts here and there but none of them were from the group I hung out with. I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I was kind of waiting for us to go out and eat or something like that but it never did. And we didn\u2019t really do much after school started either.\n\nI didn\u2019t blame them for it at all. I was a little bummed but hey, it\u2019s the beginning of junior year and things are bound to get busy. So I shoved the mood into the back of my mind.\n\nThen my other friends birthdays start to come up. And then we do the whole chat group thing all over again and pitch in to buy gifts and plan for dinner and whatnot.\n\nAnd like I said, I was happy to help out. We pitched in to buy things and do everything just like we do every time someone\u2019s birthday hits. Just not mine.\n\nLast year was somewhat the same but I did get a card with everyone signing stuff on it. Nothing else though.\n\nI just want to know how to deal with this I guess. I hate feeling jealous and being jealous of my own friend group makes me feel even worse. But it\u2019s been cooking in my mind ever since August, and it keeps coming up every time we celebrate another one of my friend\u2019s birthdays.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019m just too sensitive and should just suck it up. \n\nBut is it wrong to feel jealous?

His brother and girlfriend (that he lives with) were drunk in the back seat. Initially she was laying on her side and had her head in his lap but maybe 10 minutes later I saw in my peripheral her suddenly pantless with his brothers hand doing the dirty. I didn't have the guts to call them out when I noticed. We even went through a drive through and the kept going. I was trying to pretend like I never noticed and thought my friend would eventually realize. She was even moaning at some points. He did turn his head a few times but never enough to realize her pants weren't on. He was being so especially nice to her in those moments too, it was heartbreaking. \nOnce we got to his house where my car was parked we went inside his house and he didn't notice anything weird. We got settled around the TV where she held her blanket up for a moment (assuming she was reremoving her pants) and tried pressing her feet against me to get my attention but I was ignoring her pretending like I was absorbed in the show. She upped the anti a few time and eventually put her leg on my lap. Friend still oblivious laughing and eating. I moved her leg of my lap but she eventually got up and asked the brother to come check out \"the food situation\" to which they disappeared into this 1 bedroom house. As soon as the show ended I left because I don't plan on witnessing a murder. Last I spoke to him was me entering my car and him being confused where his brother was since he expected him to be smoking on the porch.\n\nI feel guilty not calling them out during the act but I couldn't work up the nerve to do it and was just envisioning a giant fight breaking out in a moving vehicle. I want to talk to him and let him know what I saw. What's the best way to handle this situation? There's a good possibility he's already found out, but how do I bring it up to show I wasn't trying to keep it a secret from him for them. His girlfriend and brother have utterly lost ALL the respect I had for them.

We've been unhappy for 2 years now. He married me knowing full well I did not want children, and that I had 2 cats who I love and are part of my family. I moved from a different country to the US, left family and friends behind. My mom took care of my cats for 2 years until I had all my papers in order and could bring them to my home. My mom brought my cats to me and spent a month with us (I wanted her to enjoy her stay to the fullest since the tickets were so expensive and I had no idea when she could come back for another visit) after my mom left my life turned into a nightmare. At first I wasn't sure why, he was just cold all of a sudden. I struggle with panic attacks and just the idea of asking what was wrong paralyzed me. When I finally found the courage to do it he burst into a fit and said he wanted kids and said he was going to resent me if I didn't give him what he wanted. He started to be mean to the cats too and I think he was even jealous of them. For the first two years of our marriage it had just been us two and I think he didn't want to share the attention. He said he didn't want to support the cats and I totally understand that so I got a job to help him with bills and rent (when we got married he didn't want me to work), but he still wasn't happy. He started to chase one of my cats around the house to the point of my cat being terrified of him. As a result the cat would feel threatened and hiss at my husband making him mad, so he started to kick the furniture around and kick whatever door my cat was trying to hide behind. The more I tried to protect my cats the angrier he got. I really tried to keep the peace around the house and I never treated my husband any different because of the cats. Now on top of that he started saying he doesn't want my family to come and visit because they come from too far and would stay too long, but in the 4+ years we've been married my mom only visited once for one month. Is that so unreasonable? He also said that if I'm not happy I know where the door is. Oh and he's also jealous of the only friend (29f) I have here. Last week I've found an apartment and I'm signing the lease tomorrow. My husband had once suggested that we stayed married but lived in different apartments and I know some people make that work so yesterday I told him I had found a place and wanted to try and save our marriage but he said no to that. My question is, am i being unreasonable? I really want to know if there's anything else I could do or could have done.

We dated through college and got married when we turned 22.

But now that we're married and she's in a job she loves, it hasn't stopped. I have ADHD and anxiety, so I go through moments where my brain just doesn't cooperate (being somewhat forgetful, a little impulsive, or just not being able to think). I'm getting treatment for it and I'm trying hard every day to the point I get headaches. Whenever this happens, she snaps at me. It's not just regular snapping, though. She will get to the point where she is saying things like \"you can't do anything right\", \"how can you be so stupid\", \"you're the reason things go missing\", or \"I hate you\". Never has she apologized afterwards, it's always me who has to beg to be forgiven. Whenever I talk about something I'm interested in, such as film design or science, she'll give this blank look, making it obvious that she doesn't care, then will say \"I really don't care about that stuff, that's your thing\".\nShe just seems to be really selfish and controlling a lot of times. I've expressed this to her, and she's said things along the lines of \"then stop making me mad\" or \"stop being so sensitive\" or \"so nobody is ever allowed to criticize you?\"\nI know that I can be forgetful and sometimes I can't think straight, but I can't help but feel this isn't normal for relationships.

For background, please read the original post I made before this one.  In this new post I am going to provide more background to the situation over the 9 years we spent together including many things I suppressed long ago, as well as updates to the situation I am in now, and the clarity I find myself in.  \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/d63l8e/i\\_29m\\_think\\_my\\_wife\\_29f\\_has\\_been\\_cheating\\_on\\_me/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d63l8e/i_29m_think_my_wife_29f_has_been_cheating_on_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nFirst, additional information to the story (there is a lot here so I will only list them as bullet points):\n\n1. Mid July she started talking to this guy, and I knew, I waited for her to tell me but she didn't mention it until early August.\n2. End of July she showed me a new credit card she got in the mail, she never mentioned she needed a credit card or that she was opening one until it was in her hand.  For reference, this is her 3rd credit card.  This nearly broke into a fight, but I let it go.\n3. After she sprung the news that she's been talking to this guy, she called him every chance she could.  For example, I made a joke she found funny one sunday morning and immediately called him to tell him about it.  She even called and spoke with him on her way home from work most days, instead of calling me.\n4. Around this time her brother was suicidal and her grandmother was on her deathbed, and being the support structure for both her brother and her mom.  I only mention this because a lot of times she was on her phone, I tried to give her space to help them.  Maybe she was talking to this guy though, I never knew.\n5. I've met an ex boyfriend of hers before, and he was very respectful, nice, and cool.  We even became better friends than her and him were, so I give everyone a chance.\n6. This is a long one and covers details of when he was at my house.  My one year old son was having sleep regression and didn't sleep very easily during this weekend.  The night this guy got to my house, I went to bed and let them catch up.  I woke up at 2:30AM to find my bedroom door closed and her not beside me.  I went downstairs to find them on the couch next to each other with him holding my awake son.  I was pretty freaked out but they said he woke up and they closed my door to not wake me up.  I let it go.  The next night my wife went to bed early and I stayed up to get to know this guy.  One story stood out to me, that his coworker's wife is close to him, and he constantly gives his coworker a hard time that hes going to get with her.  Just his joke I thought, and I tried to allude to that not being very cool of him but whatever. The next thing he said was that he joked to his coworker that he's coming to visit us this weekend and that he's going to break up our marriage and bang my wife.  His coworker told him no, no, don't do it thats messed up, but he said its just a joke that he kept going, as he laughed while telling me this.  Everyone I've spoken to told me I should have kicked him out or beat his ass at this point, but I didn't, more frozen in place that someone would say this to me.  He also told me he was envious of the life we had built, and he wished it was his.    \n7. Sunday morning my wife and I had sex.  But the rest of the day she spent making jokes that I don't want her, and that I never fuck her, and how horny she is.  The whole weekend they had been talking about a movie we should all watch.  But when Sunday night came and we sat down to watch it, they both went outside to smoke and I sat there watching 80% of the movie by myself with my son.  I went to bed around 11 as we both had work the next day, and they stayed up until about 1am talking about...whatever I guess.  \n8. About a week later I asked her if there was anything sexually we used to do or that she's always wanted to do to spice things up.  She didn't seem to care for the question and said she would think about it.  She never answered it.\n9. Flash forward to early September I sat her down the day before I kicked her out and told her how insecure I felt, and that nothing seemed good enough for her.  I broke down, in tears, a complete mess, I had never been this emotional.  She sat there emotionless, not upset, not happy, not anything, just didn't care at all.  In fact told me its my fault and I need to try harder still.  I get that lack of confidence is not attractive, but this is my wife...We only moved forward after I asked her to hug me and tell me it would be okay..after some time, she did that.  We had sex after this, and she was far far more aggressive and passionate than ever before.  I liked it, but in my head..it felt like her fantasy of someone else.\n\nUpdates for the day of and following kicking her out:\n\nShe immediately took off her wedding ring and said she is no longer interested in a relationship with me and that she's lost all respect and love for me, not even considering marriage counseling.  Continues to put all blame on me and that nothing is her fault.  Says she can never forgive me of ever considering that she could cheat on me and that I've broken every vow I made to her on our wedding day.  She has been talking to me but only as a distant acquaintance.  Said she will never keep my son from me, and I can see him whenever I want, and in time she wants us to be friends for our son's sake.  She's already picked out an apartment and has applied, and plans to move mid November.  She plans to divorce in a year or two when she can save up some money. I try to go over there 3 or so times a week, and her family acts like nothing is wrong, and she has not told them why she left.\n\nHer explanations of the story:\n\n1. The credit card is her credit card and has nothing to do with me so she didn't tell me.\n2. I didn't tell her the whole story (I told her some of it before this all blew up) about her friend and what he said so it's not her fault I didn't communicate.\n3. It also isn't her fault that I'm insecure, its not her problem.\n4. She got her friend the hotel room because he has no credit card or debit card, says that she never saw him once.  She compares it to buying a friend lunch and having them pay you back.  See's no issue with this at all.  Since it had nothing to do with me, she didn't see any reason to tell me.\n5. Says the aggressive sex is related to the question I asked her about spicing things up.  Instead of talking to me about it, she says she just did what she wanted.\n\nOther things she's claiming:\n\nShe says I changed and became a different unlikable person 8 months after getting married.  Truth is, we tried to have a kid around that time, and things got emotional.  A kid is something at the time I could take it or leave it but it is something she always wanted.  She has problems which prevents her from getting pregnant.  We did 2 years of \"trying the old fashioned way\" to fertility treatments and spent thousands of dollars.  Our last chance was IVF, which cost us about 10 grand, 15 covered by insurance, and this worked, but also ruined sex for us a little, as it became methodical and business like instead of passionate and lustful, doing it this way for 2 years.  All of the unsuccessful attempts strained her emotionally and I was there for her during it all.  While she was pregnant I did all the cooking, cleaned the house, took care of the animals and her, and every night tucked her in, kissed her, and cuddled with her with my hand on her stomach until she fell asleep.  But right now she doesn't see any of that.  She says I was never excited and I ruined pregnancy for her, the one thing she wanted in life, and that she can never get that back.  The one thing she is right on is I went home every night during the birth to sleep and take care of the animals instead of staying there with her.  But we talked about this, and it was originally her idea, telling me that it's okay and I should go home at night.  \n\nAnother is telling everyone that I forced her to take anti-depressant medication for 4 months because I couldn't deal with her emotions.  This is not true...8 months after pregnancy she was very very depressed, and I tried for months to help her through it all but nothing I did seemed to help.  I told her to see her doctor or a therapist, and that a professional might help her more than I can.  So she went and got medicine, and is blaming me for it.  I never once forced her, or even reminded her to take it.  Before she left, she told me she stopped taking it for a week now and she felt so much better, and that i should never ever make her do that again.\n\nUpdates on me:\n\nMy support structure is far better than hers.  I've gotten a lot of friends to my side to help me through everything I did wrong, and everything I did right.  Despite begging and pleading in the beginning, I have let her go.  I cannot control her, and her actions are hers.  Honestly she is a different person now, and it feels like a mid-life crisis.  At this point fuck no, I do not want her back.  The kind, loving, understanding, self-less person I knew is completely gone.  I can't say for sure if she wants to be with this guy or not, just as I cannot say if she cheated or not, but I can't focus on that anymore.  I'm looking to the future and taking things day by day.  I will protect my son if I have to, but right now is not the time.  I've spoken to a lawyer and am well aware of my options, and costs certain things will take.  \n\nA memorable red flag from years ago:\n\nI wanted to write this final piece to get feedback on.  This is not the first time I went through her email.  5 years ago, a very similar situation happened with another guy she was talking to from the same group of people she used to hang out with, but I never met him.  She became very into texting with this guy, and this is when we were only dating but lived together.  She got insecure and even called me out for cheating without actually saying the word \"cheating,\" when I wasn't.  I was just starting my career and was focused on work.  She made me stop locking the door when I go to the bathroom, something I have always done my whole life, but I stopped because she thought I was hiding.  And she called me out for taking my phone with me to the bathroom, so I stopped doing that too.  One day she got very heated and actually punched me in my face, she got so crazy.  Maybe I should have left then...but I worked it out with her and she never hit me again.  She started doing weird things like sending me nude pictures but then not being in the mood when I would meet her in the bedroom.  So one day I decided to check her emails, and low and behold I found a video of this guy she was talking to, jacking off to completion and whispering her name.  Far more damning evidence than this recent time.  But that time I didn't blow it up, I waited for her to get home from work and I asked her about it.  She didn't get mad, or upset, was actually empathetic to the situation and wanted to come up with a resolution.  She said she never asked for it and didn't do anything to lead him on.  To this day I never liked that answer, and I have a hard time accepting a guy would send something that explicit with no context, but given her attitude towards progress, I gave her that respect and we moved on.  But this recent story went down much differently.  Was that a sign?  My friend compares her to an addict, and hitting on these old guys and getting their attention is her drug, and maybe thats not far off, but she won't admit to anything in either case.\n\nIf you made it this far, I applaud you.

A few weeks ago she started  showing interest in getting piercings.  \nShe kinda casually mentioned clitoral hood piercings, but I could tell she was measuring my reaction.   \nI expressed I wasn\u2019t into it. I just don't like the look, and we are in a monogamous relationship so I figured I'd let her know I think she's beautiful no matter what and not to do this for me.  \n\n\nAnother  week goes by and she brings it up again. I could tell she wanted it and couldn\u2019t get it off her mind. I again expressed that I wasn\u2019t into it,  but said she can do whatever she wants with her own body, but to please keep me informed. I also mentioned that I thought she should wait, as we don\u2019t have money. Like.  We\u2019re dirt poor. We both decided to go back into seeking a higher education and both of us are taking classes at hard institutions full time.  \n\n\nAnother week passes and she brings it up again. She mentions it would be to add to her pleasure during sex. This hurt my feelings a bit, as I felt inadequate, but I am fairly good at checking my ego and put my pride aside--and was willing to be open to the idea for her benefit. At this point I repeat my previous thoughts, calmly and politely, and now that it seems it may be unavoidable, I also express that if she were to ever have it done, I\u2019d either like her to get the piercing from a  female or at least have me there if it were a male.  \n\n\nI know I  know. This is probably immature on my part. Maybe I have some insecurities. I\u2019m always working on myself. But I calmly and without  shaming her or giving off a controlling attitude expressed my feelings,  explained I wished I could be more chill, but this was a line for me, and we set the boundary.  \n\n\nShe agreed.  \n\n\nI  went out of town for 10 days, and when I got back she had 4 new ear piercings. She avoided sexual contact for a couple days, and I had my suspicions. Finally, things got too steamy and the truth came out as the clothes came off.  \n\n\nShe had kept this a secret from me. It wasn\u2019t a surprise. She knew I wasn\u2019t into it, and she was putting off telling/showing me for as long as possible.  \n\n\nMy reaction was calm but intense. Mostly disappointment. But obviously not what she wanted. But I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s what she expected. She probably maybe even expected me to have  an outburst. I didn\u2019t. But I paused sex stuff and asked a couple  questions. I wanted to know where she got it done and by who.  \n\n\nShe told me it was a guy, but did not say who, and she didn\u2019t tell me which shop but said it was good. She said she got her ear pierced at one place, and the clitoral hood pierced at a separate even better place.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have a male gynecologist. That\u2019s medical and professional.  But I know from personal experience (I have tattoos and piercings) that some of these shops and dudes working them are not professional and are sketchy and a little too casual.  \n\n\nSome shops are amazing. I\u2019d even say most! They\u2019re clean and hip and the people are pros and act like it.  \nBut not all shops are nice. I was worried about safety, cleanliness, sexual harassment, and her being recorded.  \n\n\nMaybe  I\u2019m paranoid. But I just don\u2019t like the idea of my wife going behind my  back and spreading her legs for another guy in a non-medical setting. My larger issue is not this, though. It was the dishonesty combined with it.  \n\n\nI  stopped sexy times. Told her how I felt and that it just felt a little like betrayal. We had agreed on my boundary even though it may have been a little silly, and she broke that trust.   \n\n\nI put my clothes on and headed out to get some fresh air and think.  \n\n\nI  know I chose here and not AITA, but you can tell me if I\u2019m an asshole  or not, or if my wife is, etc. as it\u2019s good to have other input on my  thoughts and reactions, but what I mostly want to know is some  strategies on how to handle this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional info: I just found out that she may have fibbed in order to do damage control... Digging herself deeper... Turns out she got all the piercings at the same place and that the guy who did the vaginal piercing goes to her school.

I have been happily married for 6 months and my wife (25f) and I have total trust when it comes to us socializing without each other present. I like this job and I was finally feeling like one of the guys, so I was happy to accept!\n\nI am the first to admit that I drink a bit more than I should- I never drive drunk or put myself/others in danger, but one sometimes leads to.. a lot more than one. \n\nThat happened last night. I went to a bar with one male and two female colleagues, which seemed innocent at the time, although in retrospect I can see the recipe for disaster. We drank way too aggressively (shots, etc) and around 1am, two of my companions went home and left me alone with one woman. I vaguely remember sitting at the bar drinking with just her there, and my next memory is waking up this morning in my own bed. \n\nRecalling what I did about last night, I checked my Uber history and I had gone from what I assume to be this woman\u2019s house to my residence at 1:40am. I freaked out checked and found no physical evidence that anything sexual had occurred. I thought about how to tell my wife.\n\nI heard from my work later this morning. This woman accused me of unwanted touching, presumably while I was at her house. After a couple of conversations, one of which was sympathetic to my plight, I was asked to give notice of resignation. I don\u2019t know, or remember, why I was invited to her house. It is not walking distance from the bar, so we must have gone there in an Uber/Lyft that she called. \n\nMy wife is working now, and I will tell her exactly what happened when she gets home. She could leave me. I would be heartbroken but right now it would be hard to blame her. I also need to find a new job. Its disappointing to leave the one I had, but more concerning is the possibility that my reputation in my close-knit industry is ruined, and I may have a hard time working in my city at all.\n\nObviously I am distraught. I made numerous mistakes to put myself in the position I was in last night, and though I don\u2019t remember it, I\u2019m disgusted by what I apparently did. I can only pray for my marriage.  I apologized profusely to my accuser (I got her number from our work share app) and told her that the most important thing is for her to feel safe and communicate with whomever she needs to.

This'll probably end up being a long post. This is all just my perspective and one side of the issue, I know.\n\nThe past few days, my (M31) wife (F31) had been starting fights over every little thing. The other day I asked her not to disparage people of a certain faith (we're both Christians but I've had a more diverse background) and she went off on me because I \"was just trying to prove her wrong.\" Then, 30 minutes later she said we were out of Chemex filters and that we should pick some up in (town 30 minutes away where the hipsters shop). I just said I'd order some from Amazon and she again went off that I was trying to control her and that she'd take care of it (this morning we still had no filters).\n\nThen that evening she brought up an argument we had 6 months ago and I thought we resolved. Apparently we didn't resolve it because we compromised and that's not good enough. Now she needs me to agree with her perspective. 2 hours later I ended the argument saying that I didn't have enough investment in the topic to argue with her anymore.\n\nThe next morning she brought it up again. 30 minutes later we came back around to the same conclusion as the night before. She also said she was sad about some family drama. I tried to offer what comfort I could, but I honestly didn't know what to say. It's a tough situation. So I offered physical touch and some \"I know this is tough\" words, but that wasn't good enough. I got the silent treatment the rest of the day.\n\nThis brings us to yesterday. She's still mad about the comfort thing, so I say we should get out of the house and get our minds off of it. We had a pleasant enough day, but I still feel like I've been picked at and deserve an apology. At 10:00 at night, after a very long day, she hints she wants to have sex. I say that I really don't feel in the mood, and it just feels forced right now because of all the tension.\n\nShe loses it. Slamming doors, yelling at me, the whole thing. She's never felt so rejected in her whole life. I'll say that I think I've only said \"no\" on one other occasion, and that was when I was getting over a stomach bug. After about an hour of being told how terrible I'm making her feel, she pulls out her computer and says that she was doing research and according to people (I don't know who) that the Bible says spouses can't say no when the other wants sex.\n\nAt this point I'm flabbergasted. Like, I never thought that I'd be told \"you have to do this or else\". I say this is getting us nowhere and we need to take some time to cool off. She yells at me \"oh good, husband of the year running away from his marriage. I've never felt so unloved.\" To which I reply \"You've said that four times when we've fought, I don't know when you're telling the truth\". \n\nShe gets up, slams another door open (it was already open, but she needed something I guess) gets right in my face and yells \"That's because you're getting worse!\" She was so loud the dogs came running out of our bedroom where she was and literally hid behind me.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, I'm in the other room and I hear she had worked herself into a panic attack. I go in to check on her and hello calm her down. She then locks herself in the bathroom for I don't know how long because I fell asleep. I only know I fell asleep because she then got mad at me for that as well, saying she'd never do that if I was upset. \n\nI honestly don't remember what was said after that, but she said something about thinking she was depressed. I should have been paying attention more, but we were in hour 5 of this argument and I wanted nothing more than to sleep.\n\nThis morning she apologized for 'snapping at me'. I don't feel like that's good enough. At this point I feel like I've given up quite a bit to be accommodating, and if it's not going to be enough, if I'm going to get chewed out and browbeaten when I just can't take anymore I might as well just say fuck it and do whatever I want anyway and not worry about how she feels.\n\nI know that's not the right course of action, but I don't know where to go from here. I don't feel I'm in the wrong for saying I wasn't feeling sex after what had happened. I'm of the strict opinion that both partners need to be willing to continue advances. I know there's foreplay and stuff, but its not like I was 90% of the way there and needed a little mojo.

I was struggling with cutting things off. \n\nThen, recently, she has been diagnosed with a disease, and she is quite literally unsure how long she has to live, and has confessed she wanted to spend her time with me regardless. She has not told many people about her condition. \n\nI spent the last few weeks deciding trying to support her (because I obviously still love her) even though I know that we are not good together in the long run.\n\nHowever, I would feel so guilty leaving a dying girl on her own too, nonetheless one I care deeply about. It seemed like staying and going are both bad options.\n\nIn the end I decided it was best we didn\u2019t talk. I want to be there for her, but we have already proven to each-other that we can\u2019t be JUST friends. And in the case that she is able to make a recovery, I don\u2019t want to lead her (or myself) on to something long term. \n\nI told her she can contact me whenever if she needs support, but we haven\u2019t spoken at all since I told her how I feel.\n\nRegardless of my decision I feel guilty and heartbroken. I just want to do the right thing. But fuck does it hurt. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThen, meanwhile, my best friend essentially confessed that she is really likes me and wants to date me. We are extremely compatible in every way. She makes me a better person. She gives me energy. Fits in with all of my friends etc. However the timing is extremely bad, and I\u2019m not even 100% sure if I want to date her or not since I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s romantic feelings or pure compatibility. I want to make sure I\u2019m not emotionally vulnerable going into a relationship as well.\n\nShe is aware of my current situation and knew I was hooking up with my ex girlfriend. She is so cool and understanding it makes me upset that I\u2019m not sure if I want to date her. She also thinks I need time to be single, anyways.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy best friends mom has seen us interact. I stayed at their house a few weekends over the last few months (since I was away from home.) \n\nHer mom asked a mutual friend of ours if he thinks we are compatible. Because of how well we interact (she was basically looking for validation about her feelings about me. She told my best friend we act like an old married couple)\n\nHowever, this mutual friend has feelings for my best friend. \n\nSo, his response was to essentially spill all of my personal information to her parents: that I\u2019ve been with my ex girlfriend a lot, etc etc. intentionally painting me in a very bad light. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know about my ex\u2019s disease or anything, but he definitely did not do me any favors. It also wasn\u2019t his place to say. Both me and my best friend got very annoyed since it was really not cool. \n\nThe mom has since treated me differently \u2014 I got uninvited to a family event with them later this month.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOn top of this, a friend of mine for the last 7 years committed suicide. Not relevant to this story, but affects the amount of stress I\u2019ve been under.\n\nI\u2019ve been keeping my head up until recently \u2014 it\u2019s all starting to catch up to me and I\u2019m feeling a little depressed. My friends have been supportive but it is still very very hard.\n\n\u2014 Hell, being single is hard enough for me. I\u2019m trying my best to work on finding validation through myself instead of others but I\u2019m not sure how. \n\nWhat should I do? Do I keep contact off from ex? How do I seek internal validation? Do I try or not try dating my friend in the future? Also what do I do about the mutual friend? \n\nTLDR: ex gf and I have been hooking up but I needed to put an end to it. She started dying. This made ending it even harder, but I eventually did it.

We wanted to finish grad school and pay off some smaller debts before we took on the big debt of a wedding. \n\nWe are college sweethearts and have seen each other through all kinds of crazy parties and nights out. My new wife is the stereotypical \"mom friend\". She would often DD for her friends if they went out, and if they stayed in for a girls night she would be the one to cut friends off before they drank too much and would stay just sober enough to call them a ride home if they didn't want to crash on the couch.   She drank occasionally, and I've seen her sloppy drunk a handful of times, but this was by no means a common occurence. \n\nLast week, finally, we were wed. The wedding was huge. All our closest friends and family were there. She was gorgeous in her dress and I cried when she walked down the aisle. I mean it, it was amazing. I pictured it for years but I could not have imagined how beautiful she was. We splurged on the open bar. We danced and mingled and partied all night long. We took our time interacting separately with guests so we could each enjoy the night. It was exactly what I wanted in a wedding. Until the end.\n\nWhen the time came to say goodbyes and the band was packing up and the bar was closing down, I couldn't find her. I thought at first she was outside saying goodbye, but when I did a quick scouting of the parking lot I didn't see her. I asked some of her bridesmaids and they said they brought her upstairs (wedding was in a hotel ballroom) hours ago and laughed it off. Immediately I got worried. Was she sick? Did she hurt herself? Why did no one tell me? I go up to our room to check on her but I cant find her. The bedroom was empty but the bed was messed up like someone put her to bed, the sitting area was empty, the kitchenette empty, and then I hear a noise from the bathroom. Sure enough, she was in there sick. I tried to open the door but something was up against it. I pushed harder and peeked my head in to see if everything was ok, and she was on the floor, sobbing between vomiting episodes. She was barely coherent, I couldnt understand her when she tried to talk. The smell was awful. Alcohol mixed with dinner and sweat. I called in a couple of her bridesmaids, one is a nurse, and I had them talk to her and see if she was ok and if she needed to go to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. They insisted it wasn't that bad, they had been drunker, she just needs to sleep it off, etc.. I was a little drunk too so i believed them, though I was still scared and definitely beginning to sober up. She didnt leave the bathroom. I spent my wedding night alone because she wouldnt let me back in the bathroom to help her. I got changed, laid alone in the bed we were supposed to share on our first night as a married coupl, and didnt sleep. Every few hours I heard more retching and crying.\n\nThe next morning I packed up our belongings before checkout and she got up and changed. She looked so defeated and sick. She apologized and cried some more for getting so drunk and ruining that night together, and I told her I was just happy she was ok, that we have had 8 amazing years together and one drunk night isnt the end of the world. But it was our wedding night. It wasn't just any night. The ceremony and everything was perfect. And then I spent it alone.\n\nI hate that resent her for this. And I  glad that shes ok. But I wanted that night to he perfect too.\nWhere do i go from here? Do we recreate it? A date weekend away? Wait for our honeymoon?

Alyssa was incredibly toxic and manipulative. We broke up a half dozen times or so but she would always beg me to come back and I did. After two years of madness I finally broke it off with her for good and blocked her on everything. A little while afterwards I met my current girlfriend Denise. Denise is so much different than Alyssa. She\u2019s selfless, kind, and honest. I thought Alyssa would track me down and beg me to take her back, but I didn\u2019t hear from her until a month ago. \n\nShe tracked down Denise\u2019s  Facebook account and started chatting with her. Alyssa sent all sorts of nasty messages like how ugly and uneven her eyes are(she has minor ptosis) and taunting her by describing how sex with me was like. Denise blocked her right away and i consoled her. I thought it was over, but then Alyssa somehow found Denise\u2019s email and sent sex tapes of me and Alyssa. Denise\u2019s self confidence is tattered right now and I don\u2019t know how to console her. \n\nIn the tapes I was more vocal than I usually am with Denise.(I\u2019m usually not that vocal in bed regardless of the girl I\u2019m with, its just that Alyssa wanted me to dirty talk more for the camera) Denise is jealous that Alyssa is attractive and has larger breasts(Denise was a late bloomer and was bullied for parts of high school for being flat chested) and said that I looked like I was enjoying myself more with Alyssa than I do with her. \n\nThere was also a second video which wasn\u2019t just with me and Alyssa, but a threesome with me, Alyssa, and my friend Zoey. Zoey is actually a really nice person and we\u2019re still friends. The problem is that Denise and Zoey know each other. I told Denise that I\u2019ve hooked up with Zoey before and she was fine with it. However we didn\u2019t really go into details and didn\u2019t know I had sex with Zoey in threesomes with my ex girlfriend. Not only that, but I asked for a threesome in the past. Denise said no and that was the end of it, but now Denise thinks that Alyssa is better bed because she did things like threesomes and while she didn\u2019t.\n\nDenise is really upset right now and I don\u2019t know what to do.

We've been together for about 4 years since I was about 16 years old. Since the breakup, he has been constantly harassing me over the fact that I broke up with him. I broke up with him because of the fact that he was treating me like I was more of someone on the side rather than an actual girlfriend. He would tell his friends, I was just some girl, he would never go out with me to do things and would only want me to come to his place to have sex. So I ended up ending things with him after an huge argument.\n\nAfter about two months after the breakup, he just stopped messaging me and I just assumed he just blocked me from all my platforms. About two weeks ago, I was notified by a stranger who had my phone number that someone posted my personal information and nude pictures and videos on an porn site which I am not sure is associated with this website. I thought I was having a prank played out on me but I went to this link they sent me and my phone number, my home address and my full name was posted along with a few of naked pictures/sex acts I've done. \n\nI know for a fact that my ex boyfriend is the one who did this because he is the only one I made this content for and he is clearly also in the videos too. I immediately blew up his phone with my brothers phone since I knew he probably blocked my number and I threatened to go to the police since I was underage in a good portion of what he posted but he claims ignorance and that he must have been hacked a long time ago since he does not have the nudes/videos anymore.  He then said it was my own fault for taking them and has not responded to anymore of my texts since.\n\nI was able to get the content removed from the website after contacting the support however the damage has already been done. I have had many anonymous numbers contacting me at first to send me screenshots of the stuff they saved and other rude/harassing comments. Now it's gotten to the point where people I am associated with and now my family are now getting harassing messages involving me and pictures involving me. Luckily my parents and family have been very supportive but I had to quit my job due to co-workers having seen me in such a vulnerable/sexual state. I have saved all of the conversations of my ex boyfriend on the topic and messages I have gotten from anonymous numbers with the intention of going to the police but at this point my life is fucking ruined so I don't know if it's even worth bothering.\n\nI have not left the house in the past week because everyone I look at, I fear they've seen my nudes and I can't function anymore. I've been crying nonstop at how someone I loved so much at one point of time could hurt me this badly and essentially destroy my entire life. My personal, social, and work life have effectively been destroyed and as of late, I just do not want to live anymore.

Basically he moved here and is studying the language to attend uni and I study his first language as my major. I saw his ad on the uni website and we decided to meet and start studying together. \n\nWe\u2018ve been studying for few weeks and it\u2018s been working out great. It turns out that we both speak another language so that really helped us to communicate. We both made progress and really liked eachother\u2018s company. He\u2018s really handsome, talkative, funny, dorky and I started to feel attracted to him. He would bring food from home with two spoons or invite me to get food from outside and even when I was begging to let me pay he just wouldn\u2018t. \n\nI noticed him liking me as well and so far everything was well. He lives far from my house but after studying we would take walks and he\u2018d walk me near my house and then return to his. About two days ago we went to a fair and it was a good time. He also told me that I was the first girl he hung out with and if he knew that I was a girl he probably wouldn\u2019t have wanted to study with me which I honestly found weird but he\u2018s from a muslim country that strictly separates women from men in schools and all so I didn\u2018t mind it that much (He couldn\u2019t tell my gender from me replying to his ad because my name is unisex). Yesterday we talked about religion for the first time in depth. I come from a muslim background but I never grew up with religion. For me only morals matter and I try to be a good human being. He\u2018s muslim but really strict. \n\nI didn\u2018t mind that until I heard some of the things he said and we discussed. He said women shouldn\u2018t be working because they would get exhausted and he\u2018d rather do the work and support his family. He said when he gets married he wouldn\u2018t want his wife to wear makeup or show her hair outside of the house. This obviously raised some big red flags and we started discussing. When the 2nd, 3rd and 4th wife discussion came up he pulled out a video of an Islamic preacher and I was like WTF. He did ask me if I was uncomfortable and that we could stop talking about this but I was just too curious I guess and told him it was okay. He told me this preacher was banned from preaching in some countries because a lot if non-believers would convert to Islam after his talks. I was obviously not impressed at all by this preacher.\n\nAnyway after this we left the library and started taking a walk like always. Then we sat in the train to head home and we started talking about religion again. I told him I would never stop wearing make up or dresses just because I\u2018m married and I wouldn\u2018t cut off my male friends either. He told me that guys \u201ethink certain things\u201c when they see a woman who is dressed tightly and they wish they were married. I was so disgusted with him because at this point he had already held my hand for like 1 minute because mine was cold before I let it go (I know I\u2018m being dramatic here). The rest of the trip in the train was spent more quietly and I told him I was really weirded out and the way he talked seems that the main reason for marriage was to finally have sex. He started sweating and told me no I got him wrong, it\u2018s just the mindset of most guys and that if he wanted to have sex he could\u2018ve done it but for him it\u2018s important to find love first and follow Islamic rules.\n\nBefore I left the train because it was my station he asked me 3x if I ever thought about doing the 5 times a day prayer. I told him no I don\u2018t feel the need for it and he was like \u201eI don\u2018t wanna beg you I just ask you to try, you won\u2018t lose anything, it\u2018s only 5 minutes per prayer.\u201c I told him that I\u2018m a really happy person and I don\u2018t feel like I lack anything so I won\u2018t pray but he wouldn\u2018t let loose and told me I could be happier. I asked him why he was so hesistant and he was like \u201eI care about you, why wouldn\u2018t I want the best for you? I want to see you in jannah (Islamic paradise/heaven).\n\nObviously things got horribly weird and I just don\u2018t know what to even do now. We were supposed to study today again but I told him I was too tired and asked if we could study tomorrow. I also found out that he has an Islamic instagram page with 80k followers. I think the reason he may have gotten so radical was the fact that he lost his brother to the war a few years ago because he did tell me he used to smoke cigarettes and recently stopped because it\u2018s a sin.\n\ntl;dr I got myself into this awkward situation with a guy I was supposed to study languages with.

I called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that I tell her why I was so panicked. Reluctantly I showed her my post. \n\nWe've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. I think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. \n\nFirst of all, what I picked up from her. I didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although I had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so I found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. I also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. \n\nWhat she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. \n\nWhat we both learned about me is that I have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy.

Me on the other hand i am going with just one other coworker, this will be my 6th year going to this conference, we are going to learn mostly and have a bunch of fun.\n\nMy wife only found out she was going about 2 months ago while i knew last march. I off-handily mentioned that she should just stay at the hotel with me for a week since the place she is staying is kind of out of the way (Our company is paying for nice hotel hers is not) which she agreed. We even made a bunch of plans to stay a few extra days there and actually be tourists for once.\n\nThis was fine until this week when she told me she was going to stay with her coworkers instead and act as their \"chaperone\",  which i get. But on top of that she apparently forgot to tell work to not book her a return flight, as we were going to spend some time there, now since the plans are non refundable, and said it would be weird to her coworkers if she didn't stay at all.\n\nI was disappointed, but since we have a month long vacation coming up in January i was fine with it. I said we could spend some time at night together, or when we have downtime and she was kind cagey about it since she kept saying she didn't know when she would have time to see me as her schedule was busy.\n\nToday i was trying to see if we had a free weekend, in october to go see my parents. So i enabled both of our work/private  google calendars, i ended up noticing that her week of the conference was all planned out in details. According to it she has nothing after 5pm every single day, and doesn't even start until 10am. \n\nI have never had doubts about her before but this kind of hurt. We have sex daily, and we have a great marriage. \n\nShould i just pretend to never see this, or do i push the issue. It is just bothering the hell out of me, and i don't really understand why she would tell me wouldn't have time. \n\nTLDR; Both me and wife are going to conference, she doesn't want to stay with me during the conference and told me she probably won't have anytime to see me cause her schedule is so busy, except according to the schedule that is not true.

She went to an Ivy League school, graduated with Latin Honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. \n\nShe\u2019s unfucking believable. \n\nShe\u2019s so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother\u2019s old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won\u2019t happen again) or if they\u2019re just generally hostile. \n\nI\u2019ve told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very sexist and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how I view her but I still don\u2019t know how to handle this. \n\nMy girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we\u2019re going to move in together and I don\u2019t know what to do about this. \n\nUsually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and I\u2019m not sure how to basically say \u201cmy parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways\u201d without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them. \n\nShould I call my parents beforehand and tell them if they plan to be rude they\u2019ll just never meet her?

In a round about way I called my boyfriend a loser... but I absolutely do not think that of him. Let me start from the beginning.  We were in a group chat with his family (brother, SIL, sis and BIL). We all just got back from a super fun family vacation and we\u2019ve all been chatting frequently since then. His family jokes around and pokes fun of each other a lot but he gets made fun of more than the others. He\u2019a always kind of been the outcast of the family. Like he\u2019s told me, his aunts and uncles never liked him and were mean to him, his mom hit him more than his brother and sister for no reason, and until we started dating he had always been the single one which made him even more of a target. So in the chat we were talking about Thanksgiving, him and I are traveling to his in-laws this year. Conversation started about Thanksgiving last year which was at our house and was a disaster (both of our first time hosting). I yelled at his brother (which everyone agrees was warranted) we undercooked the turkey, his brother and SIL were fighting, all around not something I want to repeat. We can mostly laugh about it now but my boyfriend always feels so guilty about it. Guilty to where he tells his family they should give us another chance and we\u2019ll make up for it, or we didn\u2019t know what we were doing. I get mad because I worked my ass off! Yes we made a mistake with the turkey but shit happens and nobody died! I feel like everytime he tells them we\u2019ll do better next time he is diminishing all of our hard work. So he says all of this again to everyone in the text messages today and I get upset with him (in person). I tell him how I feel when he says those things, again, and he tells me how its not like that and I need to calm down. Then I tell him how he always lets his family make fun of him and now its not just him they are making fun of now its me as well. And he needs to stand up for himself and me because we worked really hard. He tells me its just how his family is they don\u2019t mean it. But I think his brother can be a jerk and probably does mean some of it. And I told him that he never believes me when I tell him how his family is, like he never believed me when I told him that his mom hitting him the way she did was child abuse, (only believed it when his therapist told him).  He basically tells me I don\u2019t know his family dynamics and leave it alone. I\u2019m freaking pissed at this point and say something awful. \u201cYou need to stand up for yourself because you make me look like I\u2019m dating the family loser\u201d .  Why the fuck did that come out of my mouth. I just wanted him to understand that he is so much better than the kid he used to be that they all used to make fun of. But I now realize its sounds like I am embarrassed with who he is and care more about what his family thinks. To clarify: I absolutely, 100% do not think my boyfriend is a loser. He is amazing, hard working, and has done so much with his life, way more than I have done especially given the upbringing he came from. I love him and want to have a future with him but I don\u2019t know if that will be possible now. He understandably got extremely mad, called me some horrible names. I tried to back track and tell him thats not what I meant but I think I just made things worse. I moved into the guest bedroom but I am honestly afraid he is going to break up with me. I don\u2019t know how to apologize for this because I truly didn\u2019t mean to call him a loser but I don\u2019t think he will ever believe me.

She will have a perfectly legitimate issue with something I\u2019ve done, and before she can even complete the thought I interrupt by apologizing. The apologies are of course not true apologies but are rather an attempt to stop her from talking.

When I was 15, my mom (46F) married my stepdad. I didn't \\*really\\* approve, but my grandmother (68F), who lives with the family, was particularly distraught. What I didn't like about him was that he was not the kind of man my mom had raised me to be, thus a bad role model. Specifically: He's not empathetic, especially when it comes to those with different political views.\n\nHe's always been one for conspiracy theories, but it has gotten significantly worse over the years, especially since Trump was elected. Of the crazy things he's told us:\n\n* Bush Sr. was secretly given the death penalty for the assassination of JFK\n* JFK Jr. is still alive\n* Hillary Clinton had a clone\n* The government mind controls us through particular brands of toothpaste\n* The U.S./Australia never won independence from England\n* The globe is not warming\n* The government is using super colliders to build the Devil a body\n\nAnd that's not even to mention what he's come up with in defense of Trump. No matter what, Trump is *never* to blame. It's *always* the deep state/fake news media out to get him. I understand that people support their politicians, but this is next-level cult-like stuff. To him, Trump is incapable of doing anything wrong. \n\nAdditionally, he has for 5+ years now been propagating this \"global currency reset\" theory where [investments in Iraqi dinar](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-fans-sink-savings-into-iraqi-dinar-scam) will essentially turn all investors into millionaires. He's deeply, deeply in debt, and that theory is pretty much the only way those debts would ever be paid off. \n\nMy mom and grandma are conservatives, but they never supported Trump, with my mom even going so far as to say \"I don't see how a Christian supports Trump.\" None of us believe his conspiracy theories, but my mom has never told him so. She hasn't had an easy life, and the idea of going through the fight with him exhausts her. My grandmother and I never say anything either for my mom's sake, as we don't want to start a family fight. \n\nBut it's getting out of hand. I don't live at home anymore, but I still come home often on weekends. Every time, my stepdad has some new theory, and the few times that we've pushed back on them, he takes it personally and gets offended. We are all very tired of feeling like we can't speak freely in our own home, and (I believe) his theories are leading him to some dangerous mental spaces. When John McCain was still alive, he thought he was a child molestor, wishing he would \"drop dead\" (he made that comment after McCain blocked Obamacare's repeal). A couple weeks ago, he listed off several names of politicians he deems corrupt and said \"I think we need a few Punishers \\[to take care of them\\].\" \n\nTL;DR: My stepdad is *obsessed* with bullshit conspiracy theories and gets offended when we don't believe him, which leads my mom, my grandma and myself to avoid challenging his toxic beliefs. Over the years, these theories have gotten progressively more absurd and led him to, at least on a couple occasions, advocate for political violence in passing. My grandma and I are sick of living this way; Mom isn't crazy about it either.\n\nWhat do we do?

We are in Australia where sex work is legal. \n\nAnyway, recently he went on a work trip to Italy for 10 days. He used the services of a local MtF sex worker. He didn\u2019t tell me about it. We had sex the day he got home. A few days later I was feeling unwell and experiencing strange symptoms, went to the doctor and found out it was herpes. \n\nI confronted him about it and he admitted what he had done and that he had also noticed a spot/mark on his penis but \u2018didn\u2019t think anything of it\u2019. \n\nI\u2019m so upset that not only did he go ahead and sleep with someone without checking in with me, he also put my health at risk. The least he could have done was get an STD test afterwards. I\u2019m also now wondering if he would have ever told me if he hadn\u2019t been \u2018sprung\u2019. \n\nI\u2019ve always tried to be accomodating and understanding of his needs so I don\u2019t know why he felt the need to go behind my back. I now find it hard to trust him and I don\u2019t know if I can have sex with him again. Is our relationship salvageable? Or are we just sexually incompatible?\n\nTL;DR: My husband has kinks that I don\u2019t share, is our relationship doomed?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2108387, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My husband [M34] gave me [F29] herpes after cheating with a sex worker", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572036648, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh19et/my_husband_m34_gave_me_f29_herpes_after_cheating/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "icecreamguy112", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4oq7dtmr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570914923, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh117b/me_25m_got_stood_up_by_a_girl_25f_on_her_birthday/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dh117b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 96, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh117b/me_25m_got_stood_up_by_a_girl_25f_on_her_birthday/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570914924, "score": 144, "selftext": "I met this girl on Hinge and we've been on three dates.

Most of you were right. I'm glad I posted here because part of me felt like I was overreacting, which wasn't the case. He realized I was pretty pissed, and I sat down to talk with him. I told him if there was anything I should know, he should tell me now. He acted stupid. So I told him that if he had nothing to hide I wanted to see his phone, specifically their conversations. To my surprise he actually let me see it, but it was super obvious he deleted a lot. Sooo I went into their Facebook messenger chat and he got super nervous, so I already knew what I was going to find. Took him a few seconds before he grabbed his phone, and he confessed right after that. They 'only kissed' and it 'didn't mean anything'. My god I felt like I was going to explode. How can someone do this, so close to our anniversary too. I left and haven't talked to him since. Pretty sure they've been fucking behind my back for a while. It disgusts me, there have been a few times where we were together after he got back from the 'gym' or 'hanging out' with her. So I'm definitely getting tested very soon. Can't believe how that bitch could be so fake to me the entire time, him too ofcourse. I just don't understand why. Either I was the sidechick or she was, and I don't understand why she would be okay with either. \n\nI did sign up for the gym yesterday, so yay. She can have him, I don't want anything to do with him anymore. In a way she sort of inspired me to get fit I guess lol. I hope he does the same thing to her.

We've been together just over 3 years and she moved about 2 hours away for her Master's back in September.  This weekend is Thanksgiving here, so I'm driving to my home city to visit family. She has always joined me in the past, but this year she asked if I'd mind if she visited a friend in another city who she hasn't seen for a long time instead, and I of course told her to go for it.  She flew out this morning.\n\nWhere the titular red flag comes in is that I borrowed her car while she is away (I live inner city and only keep a motorcycle) and while connecting my Blu tooth to listen to music I noticed the other names in the paired device list, of which there were four other than mine: Hers, two female friends who I know, and one called 'Ryan (sexy)'.  Thing is.  I've never heard of any friend named Ryan.  And she's the type to talk about anyone in her close or extended network. Especially anyone close enough to be in her car and using her Blu tooth.\n\nSo what do you think relationship advisors?  Should this be setting off alarms? Am I overreacting? Should I bring it up or let it go?\n\nA few other pertinent details:\n\nShe car pools with fellow classmates back to my city every weekend.  But it's usually her roommate or other close friends who I know. I've never heard anything about a friend or classmate named Ryan.\n\nSex life has taken a bit of a dip over the last month. I only see her on weekends but normally we'd go at it two or three times while we have the chance. There was a stint of just over 3 weeks where we didn't do it again all though, partially because she had her period on one of the weekends, but she 'wasnt feeling well' for one. Of them and too busy for another (which is fair because students he busy).  It's just the overall vibe that feels off or different. We did break the spell though just before she left. I initiated, but it felt natural and was actually 'really' good.\n\nShe seems reluctant to talk about our future (again, only within the last month or two).  We used to playfully discuss things like buying a house and moving in together after her graduation, or even kid stuff, but now she doesn't bring it up, and if I do she'll respond with 'Let me get a job first, and then we can think about the next steps.'.  Again, fair enough, but it's the big picture I'm responding to.\n\nShe's been a little more mindful and cagey around  her phone.  Nothing extreme, but she seems to need to use the washroom more often and 'always' goes out of her way to bring it with her (like going to her purse or coat pocket to get it).  Even if it's just to go pee.  She didn't do this before (or at least not as much), but did it three times while we were out on the night she wasn't feeling well, and even once in the middle of the night for a good 20+ min.\n\nThat's about it.

One thing that has always been weird to me is he never wanted to give me affection, he would never kiss me or cuddle when we were sitting together or anything, but he always told me that it was just how he was and he hated affection, and I just accepted it.\n\nWe were talking the other day and I asked him what he thought life would be like if we got married and had kids etc. and he got all stressed and said he didn\u2019t want to talk about that kind of stuff, and that\u2019s when I realised that something was definitely up.\n\nSo Roger has a best friend, who for this story I\u2019ll call Pete. The two have been friends for YEARS, and they\u2019re always talking about each other. Now Pete is gay. Very openly gay. And I never thought of anything since my boyfriend is straight. Recently my boyfriend has been spending more and more time with Pete, like a suspicious amount of time. He\u2019s never with me anymore. He sleeps at Pete\u2019s house all the time, they\u2019re always out together and he always looks much happier when he\u2019s with Pete than when he\u2019s with me, he always gives Pete affection like hugs and just being close with him.\n\nI was starting to suspect something, but as I said, my boyfriend was straight. My friends were always telling me that they saw the two of them together and Roger just stopped answering his phone whenever I called him. \n\nSo, this comes up to now. I was taking to Roger again, saying how I wondered our wedding would be if we got married and he stopped me and told me he had something serious to say. He said that recently he\u2019s stopped feeling attracted to me and he\u2019s figured out he\u2019s gay. We did have an argument after that. I was just scared and confused.

Neither of us were particularly promiscuous on the app. As things got more serious we were sleeping over almost every night, and so we moved into a place together a couple of months ago. We spent two weeks over the summer in France on holiday with her parents.\n\nWhen we first started sleeping together we used condoms, but stopped doing so after a while as we were exclusive and she was on the pill. Before we had unprotected sex for the first time, I asked her if she had taken an STD/STI test since her last sexual partner (I had done so, and we live in a country with free walk-in clinics). She told me that she had, and that I had nothing to worry about as she had \u201cnever had anything.\u201d\n\nA few months ago my younger brother (24m) found out that he had caught genital herpes from a one night stand. He was pretty depressed about it, as he said he would need to make future girlfriends aware of it and no one would want to sleep with him. (As it happens he found a lovely girl shorty afterwards who was cool with it). My girlfriend and I were discussing it, and once again she said it was lucky that neither of us \u201chad ever had anything\u201d which meant we didn\u2019t have to have awkward conversations at the start of relationships like my brother.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I occasionally get the male equivalent of thrush, which I treat with a cream and it immediately goes away. But yesterday I also spotted what looked a bit like a genital wart. I didn\u2019t mention the latter to my girlfriend, but I told her that just for my own peace of mind, I was going to go for an STD test to make sure it was just thrush again and nothing else. She understood told me that she would do the same in my position.\n\nLast night I was reassuring her again (unprompted) that it was probably nothing, and I\u2019m quite open with her so I showed her what I was worried about against some pictures online. She agreed it was very obviously just a mild case of thrush. But then she suddenly admitted to me (we had both had a couple of drinks) that \u201cher ex had given her an STD\u201d but that she had it treated and it went away. I was a bit shocked and asked her to explain, and referred back to our previous conversations where she said she had \u201cnever had anything.\u201d\n\nIt turns out her previous long-term boyfriend gave her genital warts (I don\u2019t consider that an STD) and she had them treated. The thing that concerns me is that she told me about this ex near the beginning of our relationship - he was a total asshole who beat her up and cheated on her with prostitutes. She said that when she found out he was cheating she immediately went and got an STD test, and that \u201cby some miracle she had nothing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not particularly concerned that she gave me genital warts, but the deception has upset me quite a bit. She said that she liked me so much at the start that she didn\u2019t want to ruin it, and that she is truly sorry, which I believe. I feel like this is a breach of trust - people shouldn\u2019t lie about sexual health however embarrassing. I\u2019m very happy in the relationship otherwise, but this has made me have doubts about her honesty about other things.

Great, everything is fine and we were forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil she started talking in her sleep. At first I didn't realize that she was knocked out basically, but then her conversations started to make me suspicious, she's not talking about a phase she went through or an experiment in her life before we got married, she was talking about things within the last year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been married two years, we've had our ups and downs, and a lot of challenges. My dad died within the first 6 months of our marriage and then followed by her mom about 6 months later. We had a rough start. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter those conversations we had while she was on medication, I started to get really suspicious, one day I went through her old phone (she keeps dropping and breaking her phones so it was relatively new but with a broken screen). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I saw killed me inside, there were many many discussions and talks with strange men, deep intimate discussions. Some of these guys knew details about our lives that I wasn't aware of. This was more than just being friends with them. There was a fair bit of sexting and role-playing. To me this is cheating, she didn't technically sleep with anyone, but from the way the texts and conversations were moving, that was just the next step. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI confronted her about them, she started crying and telling me that she's feeling so ashamed and so bad about doing this to me. We go back to therapy and her psychiatrist says she has Borderline Personality Disorder. Now I looked that up and to be fair she does exhibit all the symptoms. However my stance is that having this does not make it ok to do what she did. From my perspective, she simply has zero impulse control. An immature person that was looking for cheap attention. There is no other way to describe, none of the medications she was on changed anything about her behavior, she was just feeling better about the life she was leading. I am not saying that mental illness is a joke or that people should just snap out of it. I just think she doesn't have that illness and is only using it to further her own desire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am rightfully pissed at her and everything, the last month we've been trying to work through it and we've made progress, but deep down inside I know I'll never be able to trust her, this has been going on for an entire year, that's half of my marriage. Deep down there is that voice that's telling me that I deserve better. That I deserve to be with someone who will at least give me back what I give them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I caught my wife talking to other guys and now I'm thinking of ending the marriage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate your help and advice.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2107234, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (M32) recently found out that my wife (F25) has been talking to many guys about the most intimate parts of our lives as well as her desire to be with other men and women, she has sent and received revealing pics on top of role-playing with them some fantasies.

Sure this is restrictive but on the pther hand I make a lot and my co workers and bosses are great so I am extremely comfortable and happy at my workplace which is an enormous step since I hated the previous place I worked at.\n\nNow with all of this come the occasional work related parties in other words sucking up to clients and this is sort of where the issue occurs.\n\nI have been with my girlfriend for 3 years and everything has been great, she is likely the woman I want to marry in the future. However in these 3 years she has went from no tattoos, no piercings apart from her ears and sort of a reserved way of dressing to all out getting tattoos, showing of her body with more revealing clothes and getting a bunch of piercings, she said she always wanted to do that but never had the confidence until she got in to a relationship with me, I of course supported it, she looks amazing so she can pull off clothes that are a bit more revealing and in general I too like tattoos and piercings(We are both metalheads so I guess it also comes with the scene etc.) But obviously at these work parties she understands as well as I do these looks need to be toned down a lot as it is about entertaining primarily clients who are primarily rich older men and women.\n\nThat brings us to last week at one of these parties, it is customary for SO's to be there if you got one and she said she would meet me inside the venue and when she arrived I was just shocked and so were a lot of co workers and clients as she had dyed her hair pink, nope not the blush pink you see now and again, full on neon pink well to make a long story sbort it raised my bosses eyebrows and it had a definite impact on how I was approached and how I approached people and afterwards my boss made it clear he was not happy.\n\nSo a fee days ago we had a conversation about it, she got mad saying she likes dyeing her hair and I told her it was impacting my work and that we had discussed similar stuff before so that I couldnt believe she would do this, well I told her she could either stop it with the hairdye or I would not take her along anymore which pissed her off even more and everytime the aubject comea up stuff gets heated.\n\nNow here is why I dont think I am unreasonable, she knows my field, she knows how strict the company is, she knows I have to impress older clients at these party things and ahe knows it impacts my job but besides that this is my livelyhood we are talking about and hers for that matter as I make far more and pay the overwhelming majority of the bills in part so she could focus on becoming a tattoo artist so I dont think I am being unreasonable here where as she obviously thinks I am.\n\nAlso let me clarify, It is not that I like or agree with these rules/norms but they are there and there is nothing I can change about that.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2107204, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am I wrong for wanting my SO to stop dyeing her hair weird colors?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572029170, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgtho1/am_i_wrong_for_wanting_my_so_to_stop_dyeing_her/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Nalyd_Fantasy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4l51w4vx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570870826, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgsnki/i_became_violent_last_night/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgsnki", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 119, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgsnki/i_became_violent_last_night/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570870827, "score": 159, "selftext": "So here is some back ground:\n\nMy wife is I'll at the moment. She has a terrible cough and its hurting her ribs sometimes but she is on top of it with medication. She is just grouchy about it. Also our son has been sleeping in our room every night for about a month at least and he is unsettled even in bed with us due to teething and also a slight cough. \n\nSo understandably she is very grumpy due to lack of sleep and also her own illness. \n\nLately we haven't had sex and the few times before, she just lay there in discomfort and basically told me to get on with it. This has made me feel like she is a sex doll that doesn't like sex so now we no longer have sex, I refuse to let sex become like that it makes me feel disgusting. \n\nBut it's been over a month and I have asked my wife if she feels better maybe she would be up for it? I believe this has also added pressure to her and this has added to her grouchyness. \n\nLast night while settling our son in his own cot bed I walked in to give her a break and let her go make a cup of tea. The room was very dark and my eyes hadn't adjusted... I walked in and I walked straight into her back. (She was laying down at his level half inside his cot with him, cradling him and lightly tickling his face this helps him nod off to sleep) I kicked her back as I was stepping forward by mistake. I apologised profusely for this but she got really upset and violent and hit me on the arm while she was upset. I apologised again and took over from soothing our son. \n\nBecause of this commotion my son became restless again and was crying. During the day sometimes doing something funny distracts him from his outbursts of crying. So I placed my hand over his mouth to make the Indian waa waa waa noise as he exhaled in his crying. This works during the day and he laughs and calms down.\n\nWe have a baby monitor with a camera so if were in a separate room we can see him when he is asleep.\n\nMy wife was watching the monitor at the point I was trying to distract him from his crying and she thought I was trying to cover his mouth completely with my hand to get him to be quiet. (NO NO NO I have never done this and never will) so at this point she stormed up the stairs in full mother bear mode. She stepped into the room and I was just expecting her to tell at me for being shit at soothing him and then her to take over. \n\nShe instead started to point at my face and shout and she also trying grabbing my arms. Bearing in mind i was tired, it was dark, we were both already upset by the kick in the back accident and with our son constantly screaming. She came at me as if to attack me. She had already hit me previously and I thought she was going to hit me again. \n\nI grabbed her arms and pushed her away from me. I never let go of her. It was just to get her arms restrained and away from me so she couldn't hit me. Unfortunately she stepped back again after I had her sufficiently at arms length from me so she couldn't hit me and the combination of my push and her stepping back she backed into the wall. \n\nAt this point she flipped out and said I was trying to hit her and she was literally screaming for me to get out of the house. I am not that guy! We have been married for years and together for years before that I have never hit her once! She even got our son out of the cot and began to turn away from me with him as if I intended them both harm. I just couldn't believe how much she was over reacting. That she would believe I would intentionally harm my own wife and child. \n\nThis morning I explained things from my perspective to her. She accepted this all calmly and agreed that I wasn't intending to harm her but I also did apologise for pushing her. She has left for work and I'm looking after our son today. He is snuggled up with me now watching some TV almost ready to nod off to sleep for his morning nap. \n\nI just feel so shaken by all of this. I don't know how to react or how to make things better. I don't know if she loves me anymore or even if I should consider leaving her if she truly believed that I could be that kind of guy?

I really appreciated all the support and advice I was given. \n\nSecondly, before I get to the update, I want to answer some questions that kept popping up but I was too tired to answer individually:\n\n**Some of you questioned if he\u2019s always been pressuring me into what we do in the bedroom.** I would once again like to reiterate that no, this is not the case. I have never before done something I did not want to do. Let me be honest and say my family was one of those \u201cwe don\u2019t even say the WORD \u2018sex\u2019 in this house!\u201d types so my information on sex came solely through the internet all throughout high school. My fianc\u00e9 has only ever explained misinformation to me; like I said, I have given him a hard no before and he took it well.\n\n**Some of you guessed that he\u2019s already cheating on me/has someone in mind.** This has also crossed my mind and has really taken a toll on me for the past few days. I\u2019ve been paranoid and I couldn\u2019t help but think of everyone we know and wonder if he\u2019s been sleeping with them/wants to sleep with them. I\u2019ll get back to this in a minute.\n\n**Some of you asked if he was wanting a MMF or a FFM threesome.** Again, I\u2019ll address that.\n\n**Some of you suggested pretend-agreeing with the threesome if I got to choose who we did it with/if we did it with another guy/etc. so I could \u2018catch\u2019 him.** I can see how that might be satisfying/telling, but idk, that wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do. Sorry.\n\n**To those of you who ironically suggested I actually do it:** Ha, ha. You\u2019re hilarious.\n\n**To those of you who unironically suggested I actually do it:** Ha, ha. You\u2019re hilarious.\n\n**To that one person who said our sex life has become** ***too*** **kinky and we now that we no longer have anything to hold us back, me and my fianc\u00e9 are now pretty much becoming sex demons:** I am concerned for you.\n\nOn to the actual update:\n\nBetween reading everyone\u2019s responses, getting some alone time, and taking the day off of work, I had a lot of time to think. I thought about our relationship and if I truly wanted to marry this man, whether this meant I could trust him anymore, if this could only be the tipping point of a much bigger issue, etc. Yesterday wasn\u2019t a nice day to me. I felt pretty sick, to be honest.\n\nWhen my head started to clear, I decided that I really, really needed answers. I texted my fianc\u00e9 (who was at work) that we were going to have to talk when he got home: not a \u201cI changed my mind\u201d talk, not a \u201clet me scream at you\u201d talk, but a calm, serious talk between adults. He agreed.\n\nHe came home pretty late (long shift), we sat down, and we talked.\n\nRight off the bat: Was he cheating on me? Did he *want* to cheat on me? Was this why he was bringing it up?\n\nHis answer: a very hard, firm *no.* He swore up and down for what felt like hours that no, no, no, he was not cheating on me and never *wanted* to cheat on me. He doesn\u2019t just want a threesome, he wants a threesome that I\u2019m part of. The idea of having sex with one person who isn\u2019t me, or two people who aren\u2019t me, does not interest him. (I\u2019ll come back to this) I believe him, but I can\u2019t put into words why.\n\nSo, just to be clear, I asked him if that meant he didn\u2019t have someone in mind lined up. \n\nHis answer: no, not really. He guessed that if I had agreed to it then we could maybe use one of those hookup websites/apps and find someone. He thought about asking someone he knew maybe once and realized that no, he probably would never be able to look them in the eye afterward.\n\nAfter he said this, I realized that we were being pretty gender-neutral about this \u201cthird party\u201d. So in curiosity, I asked him if he wanted a MMF threesome or a FFM threesome.\n\nHis answer: he honestly didn\u2019t have a preference one way or another, but he finds the idea of a MMF threesome a little more appealing. He said something that one of the commenters that the last post brought up: that pleasuring two women at once would probably be very difficult.\n\nWhich brings us to the biggest question: why he *so very specifically* wanted a threesome. Out of all the ideas and experiments we\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve never before seen him so fixated on an idea. I needed to know why.\n\nHis answer: the idea was just really, really hot to him, as he said before. Now, I\u2019ve known him long enough to know that sex is a pretty important to him. He loves me, and I love him, and sex (wherever it places on the \u2018vanilla-to-kinky\u2019 scale) is how we express love and affection. Plus, you know, it feels great. So I know why he wants sex to be enjoyable, but I asked him to be more specific. Why a threesome, specifically? What is it about a threesome that is so much more enticing to him than a sex toy/position/etc?\n\nHis answer, revised: he couldn\u2019t put it into words, but he thought that maybe it had something to do not so much with having 2x the people to make him feel good, but with watching *me* be pleasured from a different POV with him still being there. He said that if I slept with someone besides him on my own, he\u2019d be pretty PO\u2019d, because again, sex is important to us. BUT, if I slept with someone and he was also there, he\u2019d be fine with it. I responded with something like \u201cwhy didn\u2019t we just make a sex tape you could watch, or something?\u201d He said it wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\n\nHe also finally admitted that he had a wet dream about us having a threesome a while back and it gave him that idea. He didn\u2019t want an open relationship. He didn\u2019t want a polyamorous one. He wants to be the only person to have my love, but he\u2019d be fine sharing my \u2018body\u2019, even if only for one night.\n\nSo that answered a lot of questions and cleared some things up. Unfortunately, even though this conversation didn\u2019t end in a screaming match and swinging fists, it didn\u2019t end with sunshine and rainbows.\n\nI talked for a long time, and he listened. I told him about how his mindset and my mindset about this weren\u2019t compatible. He wants to be the only person I love, but is okay with us getting intimate with a third person. Meanwhile, I am incredibly uncomfortable with being with anyone else intimately, regardless of whether he\u2019s part of it or not\u2014and on top of that, watching someone else make him feel good (male or female) would probably make me sick. I told him that because of my feelings, I was paranoid that he had his eyes on someone else. Yes, he said this wasn\u2019t the case, and no, I don\u2019t think you can\u2019t find other people attractive once you\u2019re in a relationship. In this case, though, it felt like he found someone he was attracted to and was trying to find a way to pursue them. \n\nMost importantly, I told him that his behavior in this argument made me feel\u2014for the first time in our relationship\u2014unsafe. For the first time in our sex life, I told him \u2018no\u2019 and he refused to take it as an answer. He turned the conversation on me to guilt me into doing something with my body I wasn\u2019t comfortable with. By being terse and distant, he was giving me an ultimatum: put yourself in an incredibly uncomfortable position for my gain, or I\u2019ll be upset.\n\nHe didn\u2019t deny any of this. He apologized over and over and swore he never meant to hurt me, but he didn\u2019t try to lie about what had happened, nor did he justify what he did.\n\nIt\u2019s possible he lied to me about some things. Some of what we talked about was contradictory or very confusing. It doesn\u2019t feel very much like we\u2019ve solved the core issue, but I cannot tell you what the core issue is.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the wedding is called off. I love him\u2014I love him so, *so* much, but this experience has left me shellshocked. I will say we haven\u2019t gotten too far in the planning stage, so we\u2019re not losing anything by putting things on pause.\n\nI also don\u2019t know if we can have a relationship after this, period. Yes, I want to live a blissful married life with the man I love, but now I\u2019m wondering if I know said man as well as I thought I did.\n\nNot sure how the future will turn out. In any case, I again just want to thank you all so, so much for your support. I made the original post because I wasn\u2019t even sure myself if this was a disagreement or a dealbreaker. A lot of responses I got really made me think about the things I needed to think about.\n\nI\u2019ll answer a few questions if I can in the comments. I\u2019ll leave this post up for a few days and then I think I\u2019m just going to delete this account and peace out.

She has been way less interested in any sort of physical contact. For example, she was having a bad day and so I bought her some flowers and a dessert that she likes.

They all looked really sheepish.\n\nBasically we worked out a deal. As a settlement, a full 5 months salary on top of my current month, \u00a33000 car settlement and my usual 5% bonus of my salary. And they'll write me a \"glowing\" personal reference. \n\nHonestly, I was going to look into prosecuting them, but I just want it to be over so I accepted. \n\nHopefully I can move on professionally. \n\nOn the subject of my now ex, I decided to read the little boy's Letter. It was more of s note, but it basically said \"Dear XXXX. I'm sory, I love you. Yor my best frend (or something like that). \n\nIf I was a cold person, I'd not feel bad. I'm not at all, and I hadn't drunk for a couple of days. \n\nSo I sent him a note in the post too.

I know that love is supposed to transcend everything, but there\u2019s normally a reason we have sexualities at all. I\u2019m attracted to women, and while this wonderful woman is amazing, her body doesn\u2019t fit my personal needs. \n\nI get mixed messages because some of my friends (even some of the trans friends) feel like \u201ccompatible\u201d means that if I don\u2019t want to sleep with a male body I shouldn\u2019t feel bad. Others think I should ignore the anatomy in favor of her mind. I guess I feel like I want both to align, and we\u2019re all selective. \n\nDoes that make me the asshole?

At the beginning of this year we moved out to the country, as we both wanted to get away from the homeless problem in our city/near his house and to sell before it became too big an issue. While I enjoy country living, I still work in the city and have an 1.5 hr commute each way (so 3 hr total) every weekday. So we don't get a whole lot of time together during the week, and we pretty much never leave the house except for groceries because everything is a 30+ minute drive away. BF works ~20 hours a week, the rest of the time going to doctor's appointments or hanging around the house/working on his cars.\n\nLast week his sister flew down from LA to handle some personal business and they've spent the past few days just cruising around having fun. Only thing is, all the fun stuff they're doing is stuff I've asked BF to do with me and he said no or dismissed.\n\nWe have a VERY popular swimming hole nearby that BF had already been to before. I asked to go there and he said it wasn't worth it and to not waste time with it. What do you know, his sister's first day here they go swimming there and when I get home at 7PM they regale me with how amazing it was.\n\nThere is a local farmer's market during the week that I can't make it to because it's during working hours (I've never been to a farmers market). I happened to have a required day off one day on a market day and asked if BF wanted to go with me. He said everything was overpriced and his parents gave us farm fresh stuff from their garden and animals anyways, and that it was probably mostly CBD peddlers and goats milk soap. Feeling really discouraged, I ended up not going, but spent time together otherwise. Her second day there I come home to a fridge full of fresh fruits/eggs/meat and a box on the counter with used cupcake liners inside. None for me. This was were I really started to get ticked off. \n\nWe have almost all our meals at home, which can be draining as BF doesn't start making dinner/waits for me to start on dinner when I get home, leaving me barely enough time to cook it all and eat before having to go to bed. I've asked repeatedly if we can go out to eat if I'm not in the mood for all that rigmarole, but he just says that we have food and he can just cook it if I'm tired. It's not a bad compromise, but I've told him about cool restaurants around town and places I miss eating at in the city and he says when we have time we'll try them. And the past couple of days he's told me to just pick up some food  for myself because he and his sister are eating at the hip new gastro-pub next town over or at the winery near by's italian restaurant. Also, all that farm fresh meat and produce they bought at the farmers market is wasting away because they keep eating out.\n\nReally my breaking point wasn't until last night. There is a cool little town about an hour away that I'd wanted to visit because my favorite candle factory is there and they have a well-regarded fall fest and famous BBQ spots. BF at least agreed a day trip out there would be fun, but that we could go out there once things started to 'settle down'. I've brought it up a couple times since then, but he keeps putting it off, declaring more important things take priority. Last night I came home from working late and they sheepishly tell me about their trip and how much fun the fall fest was, going through the corn maze, bobbing for apples and that they'd had dinner at the BBQ place and fed the leftovers to the dogs. They'd visited the candle factory, but didn't buy anything.\n\nI'd had enough at that point and went to bed quietly, feeling really silly for being on the verge of tears over this. Since I also leave early in the morning I haven't had a chance to talk about my feelings, but I don't know how to handle it. Part of me feels like I'm making too big a deal about this. With me working and his sister being here I'm sure they would have included me if I could take the time off. \n\nAnd I know she came down here without any clear plans of what she wanted to do, so I'm sure all those things I keep pestering him about doing readily came to mind when he had free-time with his sister to spend, and my work/commute schedule makes it hard to do any of that. But that doesn't change how down on myself I'm feeling about this entire thing. Like for some reason I'm not good enough to do these things for, but when his sister comes into town he pulls out all the stops. Logically, I know there's not much to stop him from doing those things with me when we both have free time, and he doesn't get to see his sister often, but this entire thing has me twisted.\n\nAm I right to be jealous? How do I discuss these feelings with BF in a reasonable way? I feel like my feelings are reasonable, but I'm not sure what I would have expected them to do as an alternative. \n\nTL;DR BF and I live out in the country. Due to my work schedule we don't get out much together, but when we have time he dismisses things I want to do. His sister came down to stay with us and he's taking her to do all the things I ask him to do, and now I feel intensely down on myself for it, and slightly jealous.

On its face, this should be the absolute happiest time of our lives and our immediate family as this is the first grandchild for both sides of our family. Part of this process is the baby shower, which again, on its face, should be very straight forward. \n\nI was out of town on a work trip this week when my wife called me before work bawling her eyes out because she had gotten into an argument with her sister, who is throwing the baby shower, over a game. The sister had planned to play the baby food game (still hazy on what exactly this is) and my wife doesn't want to play it. My wife asked her not to play that game and the sister told her she already had all the materials and she could just sit it out if she didn't want to play. \n\nUnderstanding my wife's emotions are a bit high right now with the pregnancy I helped calm her down over the phone knowing I would be home that evening. I got home yesterday and figured, the best path here would be to try to talk to my MIL and see if she could help mediate this and find a compromise. \n\nI called my MIL and she was definitely resistant to it, she sides with the sister and thinks that my wife is being bossy and rude, because the shower is a present and rejecting any part of it is a slap in the face. I tried to explain the emotions part and she wasn't really accepting that. I asked her if she would talk to the sister, and tell her I would even pay for whatever materials she invested in the game so she wouldn't be out any money, just if we could find another game to play. This really should not be a big deal at all. My MIL was on board with this and said she would help work it out. I really thought that was the end of it. \n\nThis morning I was woken up to a call from my MIL. She was hysterical and crying about how everything was so messed up and that my SIL is now seriously depressed and almost didn't go to work because of how my wife was treating her like dirt and being bossy with her. She went on for about 5 minutes straight about all kinds of family issues I didn't really even know where a problem, all culminating with this dumb baby shower game. I told my MIL I was clearly not qualified to handle this and needed to think of a way we could get the whole family together to discuss these issues because this was clearly much larger than just a baby shower game. \n\nI am now at an utter loss and don't even know where to turn. My wife and her whole family are very classic Midwesterners that like to just shove issues down and not acknowledge them, and when they finally do, it's a ticking time bomb of shouting and crying. I am highly certain a suggestion of a counselor or therapy would be met with anger and more emotions. I just don't know where to turn at this point and hope that maybe some stranger on the internet from 1000' above can help offer some advice on a good path forward. \n\nTl;dr wife is pregnant, her younger sister is throwing baby shower and planned a game my wife didn't want to play. Sister won't take the game off the plan and my covert plan to work through my MIL to resolve it has now turned into an explosion of emotions dating back 30 years of sibling rivalry and family drama.

Obviously. Also posted this on AITA but decided that, after a judgement, I also need some advice.\n\nWe (18 F) both wanted to go to a pretty prestigious school in the UK (we are from a less-developed country in Europe) and, lo and behold, we both got in. Our problem started in August when my sister completed her accommodation forms and specifically requested me to be her room-mate. Because we have been sharing a room for 18 years. Because we are best friends. Because we are *twins*.\n\nI did not want to. After some back and forth with our college, I made sure that we would both live in en-suite rooms and have a room-mate. Just, not each other. My sister was so mad at me she refused to speak to me until mid-September. I contacted my roomie at the beginning of September and have become fast friends, so we were already super-close when uni started. My sister got her room-mate's email as well, but she refused to contact her. The girl even sent her two emails, which she didn't respond to, to my knowledge.\n\nSo, uni started more than a month ago, and I've been talking to my sister less and less. We study different things ( I study business management - she, the Classics), so none of our courses align, she never calls, she never wants to have lunch with me or go with me to any of the fresher events. At some point, I started pestering her to (didn't work). I love uni, people finally know who I am as a person, instead of \"one of the twin girls\". I know my sister is kind and smart and hilarious, so I thought she would have no problem accommodating at uni without me.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from my mom. She was furious and told me to speak with the administration immediately and have me and my sister share a room again, because she wants to completely withdraw and go back home. I refused, because I love my roommate, our dynamic, our room and this new student-life-experience. This is the first time me and my sister don't have to wear identical clothes, get identical haircuts and go everywhere together, and I love it!! She told me that, if my sister drops out, then I'll have to, as well. She pays for my accommodation, so I'm fully dependent on her. I hung up on her and have been on the edge since. Is it my fault that my sister wants to quit her studies? That she doesn't talk to me? My grandmother called me this morning and called me a spoiled brat, and maybe she's right. I don't even know if my sister will want to stay here if we move in together. I don't know what to do. Is there a *best solution* in this situation? The last thing I want to do is make my sister suffer, but I don't want to give in and let my mom control me.

This was because we don't see each other as often and we figured it was a good way to keep the relationship healthy. This was right before we managed to get a apartment together (Leaving my family and extending my commute to work about an extra hour so she can be closer to work and school). About maybe a week after this, she mentioned a guy that found her attractive at work, she is attracted to him as well and they both expressed this to each other. Gradually they started hanging out together after work in her car and naturally he made his move. She told him she's taken (showed her ring) and that it can't go any further.\n  \nFast forward two weeks later I got home super late at like 1am and I noticed she still isn't home yet. 3 hours later she comes in super joyful striking up conversation about random stuff. I thought it was odd because I'm the night owl.. She doesn't have many friends and even I cant get her to stay up past this time. I knew it was the guy from work and she even told me it was him. But they were just playing uno and hanging out. A couple days later I managed to get her to talk about that night and what she was doing.\n\nAt some point in her car that night they were cuddling, he kissed her neck and grabbed her ass. She followed through and did the same and grabbed his junk. She said in the moment she thought what she was doing was OK because she thought she had a \"free pass\" and that it wasn't that serious since they only kissed on the neck and there was no sex. She said she was finding the right time to tell me because she knew I would be upset. This doesn't make sense to me because it just means that she knew what she was doing was wrong.\n\nShe even asked me if that was cheating.. I reminded her about the \"nothing physical\" rule. Ever since we spoke about it she's been pouring her heart out about how sorry she is and that she will drop him immediately. But I still feel betrayed because I 100% trusted her to be able to make the right judgement in situations like this or to even prevent it from getting this far. She clearly isn't mature enough and it doesn't help that Inconvienced myself by moving this far away for her.

Basically, in complete shock right now. My girlfriend of two years started distancing herself from me. She'd always say she isn't in the mood to cuddle or hang out. She would eat dinner without me. I thought she was just going through a phase. However, I decided to talk about it, at first she was being vague in her responses and denying any changed behaviour. After a lot of persuasion she finally opened up. She said she doesn't feel happy in our relationship and wants to break up. The main reason she said was that 'I don't have an apple phone anymore'. When we met in Uni, I had an Apple phone, our relationship made heavy use of Apple-specific features like Facetime and iMessage. My (ex)girlfriend said that once I got an android phone, we stopped facetiming and imessaging as much as we used too (we don't live together, but sleep over on the weekends but would video call on the weekdays most days). She believes that I prioritized better technology over her and wanted to distance myself from her, and so she broke up with me. We started using more of Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp to video call, but she said its just not the same. I apologized and denied that I changed phones for that reason.  However, she was set on breaking up. Fast forward, to a week later, she called me saying we can get back together if I get an Apple phone. I'm at a loss of words right now, I can't believe my girlfriend won't let me use my current Samsung phone if I want to stay with her. Using an android phone is SO much better than Apple, and I feel selfish that part of me doesn't want to give up my phone for her? I love her but why can't she see past this?

Since she became a teacher, her evenings and weekends have been completely taken up by preparing lessons or crafting for her classroom. 9 times out of 10, the topic of conversation with her is what the next lesson will be, or what this one kid said that made her day, or what this other kid did to get put on a time out. When I change the subject, or try to talk about my day or my interests, or something maybe her and I could do for a date night, it lasts for maybe 2 minutes before she brings up her class again. I never dismiss it negatively. I try to show interest, and I want to be supportive and understanding because she obviously loves what she does, but I'm starting to not care. She doesn't seem to care about my day or interests.\n\nI spend a lot more time out of the house with friends or by myself because I feel alone around her and get bored of the same things every day at home.

He works at a smaller, lesser known company, and is having difficulties with his boss. \n\nRecently I've noticed that he seems to take every little thing extremely personally. For example, two days ago, when he was worried about whether his international SIM card would work for a business trip to Korea, I said off-handedly, \"Oh it should because my work phone has that SIM and it worked in Korea.\" I think this offended him (that I have a work phone and he doesn't, has to use his own phone, etc.), because we were supposed to watch a movie that night and he decided to sleep early and was in a visibly bad mood all night. \n\nThis morning I was talking over breakfast about how I didn't know what to do an unmotivated trainees I was assigned after my promotion, and he said passive-aggressively, \"Wah, woe is me, I have too many responsibilities\" in this really mocking tone. When I asked him what his problem was and why he's been so upset lately, he just said, \"Some people have real problems,\" and got up and left. I'd also asked him to look over a newsletter I'd written for my office, and he sent it back to me later that day HEAVILY edited (seriously over-edited, considering that I'd asked him to look only for typos and grammar mistakes), which made me think he did that to lash out at me and prove he was better than me somehow.\n\nThese are just a few examples of something that's been happening almost daily for the past few months.\n\nSince this has escalated, I've tried twice to sit him down and talk to him seriously about what's bothering him, not accusing but just asking, but he always says it's nothing and that he \"doesn't like to talk about feelings.\" The second time was yesterday, and when I tried to press him, he actually lashed out at me and accused me of being completely insensitive and being a psychopath with no empathy. I told him I had no idea how I was being insensitive because he wouldn't tell me what was wrong, but he said that I \"should be able to tell\" and it's kind of scary that I don't get it. When I asked him if it was about my work vs. his, he got up and left the room, and I have not spoken to him since. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I can't tell if I'm actually being massively insensitive or if we're having communication problems. I feel like his ego is wounded but if he won't talk to me about it, I can't figure out a way to fix this all on my own. I guess I could never talk about my work in front of him, but work is a huge part of my life right now and I can't imagine living that way.

She's works for herself and because she sets her own hours, she has no separation between work and personal life. Her office is a 1.5-2 hour drive from home, so she usually comes home for about 1 day a week (to work at home) before driving back, but her work has her making long drives all day all over the city. She's the kind of person who will fall asleep instantly if she sits down from exhaustion, so she'll usually avoid resting at all. \n\nShe also has undiagnosed ADHD, which is part of the reason why she overworks herself, because she hyperfocuses on her job and doesn't know when to stop. In the car she is constantly on her phone, messaging/calling/using gps. She is honestly an extremely dangerous and distracted driver. \n\nAbout 10 years ago she fell asleep at the wheel doing 70 km/hr, but somehow managed to walk away unscratched, and only damaging the car. Since then she has managed to lose her licence for repeated speeding (like, 30 km/h+ over the limit), constantly gets ticketed for breaking road rules, scratched up whichever car she drives, etc. I refuse to be driven by her now because she constantly speeds, is on her phone all the time, and often asks me to prod her to keep her awake. \n\nI got the call yesterday letting me know she fell asleep again doing 70 km/hr, again wrote off the car, and again (somehow) walked away unscratched.

I, naively, believed it.\n\nHis other girlfriend didnt, and she started seeing cracks in his lies, and saw texts from me on his phone.

Then we discovered we were both in serious relationships with the same man.\n\nOnce we found out, we dumped his cheating ass, obviously. He claims he is a compulsive liar, but I think only a fucking sociopath could manipulate and emotionally abuse two women for two years. He had never planned to end anything, and was only upset that he was caught.  I am glad that I found out, two years too late, but I dont really know where to go from here.\n\nI feel like this has completely shattered my self esteem, my ability to trust, and everything I have felt the last 3 years in our relationship. It ended so suddenly and I discovered that I had been manipulated, emotionally abused, and living a lie.\n\nHow do you begin moving on from this?

But it doesn\u2019t do anything for me that way and 99% of the time that it is on both of our feet, he manages to steal it. So half of it ends up hanging off his side of the bed and none of it on me.

Found out that the reason for my infertility is group sexual assault when I was 15. Exposed me to my husband and the family. I'm emotionally ruined. Any advice I'd appreciate. \n\nHello you lovely bunch. I promise, this is not a troll post, it's unfortunately very real and I could kill for some good advice. It's really long, I'm sorry. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for about 6 years, married for 4. Honestly, hard work but the most amazing relationship. He's my cherub. I just love him. \n\nWhen I was 15 I was assaulted by 3 men and the encounter filmed. I will say I was incredibly lucky and they were arrested, charged, convicted and served very short prison sentences. My main way of coping has been to have a diary in which I would write about my emotions, about my flashbacks and nightmares and just how it was being around other men with the past that I have. It helped a lot to get the thoughts out of my head and I could put the book away and pretend that all that had vanished from my life. It worked somehow.\n\nI never told husband that I had gone through this as a teenager, I never wanted it to change the way he thought of me or treated me. I just didn't want to be a victim. Or spoiled goods. It hasn't always been easy over the years, I can be emotional, withdrawn, sometimes very hyper, sometimes I would have flashbacks or nightmares, he was always there to comfort me and bring me back. But he never once pried. He isn't the pushy type, hes very laid back and quiet, he waits for me to tell him. I'm very lucky to have him.\n\nNow my MIL, is a lovely woman. Baby crazy. We really do get on so well. Husband is the last of his siblings to get married and the only who doesn't have kids. Because of my assault, I can never have kids. I've made my peace with it. My husband knows I'm infertile, but not why, he wasn't really that down with having kids anyway and we moved along with our life just fine.\n\nWe are currently renovating our top floor in our house and all our storage that was there is just scattered around the house. My mil was helping me organise through them and in one old box of my clothes she found one of my diaries at the bottom of it. I don't even remember it being there, that box had been up there for years. She took it home with her, read it, found out the truth about me and just blew the hell up.\n\nWe were over for dinner and she just came into the living room where I was with my hubby, FIL, SIL and her husband and my Mil's sister. And she went off. Threw the book at me and started saying that she was going to finally tell the truth about me to her poor family that I'd deceived for so many years. That she'd always known the reason I wouldn't give my husband any kids because I was such a whore and any daughters we would have would also be having sex with men as kids. That I would probably sell them myself because it was clear the devil was in me. She said I was evil, how could I have kept it a secret from them, they never would have allowed this much shame to be attached to their family name. She just told my husband all this who sort of sat shocked speechless through it before standing up and taking me by the hand and leaving. My SIL literally had to drag her by her arm to hold her back, she was just screaming about how terrible I was and he needed to leave me.\n\nI didn't say anything to him once we got home. I just told him that if he wanted a divorce, I'd never stand in his way or ask him for anything in return. He just cried and shook his head and just took me to bed and we just slept all cuddled up. It's been a week and we still haven't sat down and talked about it. We don't even sleep in the same bed, I'm not able to handle and I sleep in the spare room. And he's fine with it. I know he's giving me all my space and will wait for me to broach it with him. But I really can't. I don't ever want to even think about it. Every day I wake up feeling like I've just lived through that attack again. I have the diary back with me and just the thought of it makes me vomit. \n\nHe blocked his family members on my phone and won't allow them to talk to me or to come over and chat. I did check through his phone and he had so many messages from his immediate and extended family asking what had been going on. MIL told them all that I had an orgy and filmed it with a bunch of guys and I wasn't giving him kids because I was a selfish slut and that she needed to find out if I was cheating on him currently because he wasn't going to be allowed to pay me anything after the divorce, or give me any family property or funds. The whole family knows now that something sexual happened with me and 3 men when I was 15. It makes me sick you guys. \n\nIts my worst nightmare. I just constantly visualise myself running away and never having to deal with this ever again. I know it's killing my husband, he just looks so stressed and broken down constantly although he's just being as normal as possible and treating me so lovingly like before and hasn't said a word about those texts. And I know he wouldn't if I didn't bring it up. He's just such a sensitive, laid back guy, he's never done or said anything that makes me feel uncomfortable or unsafe. He let's me come to terms with things at my own pace and then we have our honest conversations and hear each other out so much easier. But I can't. I'm so embarrassed for us. \n\n I'd appreciate any advice please.

Probably too non-confrontational. I think it's partly because I was raised having to just \"roll with it\" and partly because that's just my personality. \n\nI don't care about being first, or always getting the best item or seat or bang for my buck or whatever.

It's not that I'm gritting my teeth and \"suffering through it\"; it just doesn't bother me enough to the point where I'd ask them to remake my food. If the food is terrible I'm not going to complain to the manager and get comped for the meal; I just won't come back to the restaurant again.\n\nIf we're deciding what to do for the evening, and my girlfriend wants to do one thing and I want to do a different thing, I'm perfectly happy agreeing with her and doing what she wants. I know I'll be happy doing pretty much anything with her, so I'd rather have her have fun too than try to force her to do what I want. \n\nThose are all kind-of trivial examples, but it does manifest in some bigger relationship issues as well.\n\nFor example, throughout our relationship we've both expressed that we want to have kids someday (keep in mind it would be 3+ years away at the earliest).

I told her that's okay, if she doesn't want kids then we won't have kids; I'm not going to force her to have kids if she doesn't want them. But then she says this is an example of me just doing whatever she says and not what I want. \n\nI'm not sure what I could have said though? \"I hope you change your mind because that's a dealbreaker for me\"? But the truth is, it's not a dealbreaker for me. I'd much rather be with her than have kids with someone else. But how do I express that without making it seem like I'm just a doormat? Or am I just a doormat?\n\nDoes anyone have experience from the opposite point of view, where your partner always just enjoys going with what you want? And how that is frustrating for you or what things you'd like to see your partner do instead?\n\nTLDR Relationship issues because I often times agree with my partner rather than argue \"my side\".

She has always told me she doesn't have feeling like that for him and never slept with him. So I never 2nd guess their friendship other then telling her I think he wants to be with her. Just over 2 years into the relationship during a disagreement she admitted to me she cheated on me with him. That's when i first found out. It was one time and she told me it just had happened she didn't mean it too. According to her he was going through a hard time and she went to his place to be there for him and one thing lead to another. It was difficult to handle hearing but at this point we are living together with our 2 kids (both were single parent when we meet), engaged, and making a life with each other. She hadn't talk to him in about a year and a half now and i didn't want to ruin everything we have just built. I have been doing my best to let it go and move on. This was this past summer that she told me. So this guy works at the community center next to but attached to the school our kids go to. They do a after school program. So now the summer is over and the school year is started and our kids dont ride the bus we pick them up and drop them off every day. I usually only go on Monday and fridays (since on Tuesday Wednesday thursday my kid is with him mom) and my fiance goes every day of the week to pick her daughter up. So i never really see the guy and never really thought of it. Now a couple weeks ago my Fiance told me she talked to him about a week before she told me after school while the kids were at the park. Since i guess he brings the community center kids to the park after school is let play for a while. They talked about about her thinking about getting a job at the community center and she told me she was asking him what it is like to work there. It bothered me but she said it was only the once and she decided not to take the job. So about 2 weeks ago we were talking and i told her i thought is was disrespectful of her to talk to him since she cheated on me with him. She told me doesn't see the big deal about it they were only talking and she doesn't see him like that. And shes a different person now. I told her it didn't matter because she cheated on me with him she shouldn't have anything to do with him any more. She doesn't really understand or see whats the big issue with it. Now this brings us to this current week. So my Fiance got a new job at a school not very far from our kids school and so now im picking up her daughter every day from school because she cant anymore. So now for the last couple days im seeing this guy at the park while im letting her daughter play at the park and we wait for my fiance to get off work about 30mins after our school lets out. Its really bothering me to see him there. Every time i see this guy it reminds me that my fiance cheated on me with him and im having a hard time letting it go. Its also starting to make me wonder how often they are talking with each other while im not around tuesday, wednesday, and thursday. \n\nIm not sure what to do. Am i wrong to tell her I dont like the idea of her talking to him or having any to do with him? Should i just do what i can to let all this go? Part of me just wants to tell her i can't pick up her daughter anymore but i dont want to ruin her new job. And then now im worried if i dont pick her daughter up then shes going to be talking to this guy when im not there. \n\nAgain im at a loss and not sure what to do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2102235, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Me (34M) and my Fiance (27F) How do i deal with seeing the guy my fiance cheated on me with?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570815050, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg1etm/me_34m_and_my_fiance_27f_how_do_i_deal_with/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fathertoobee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4rphwri7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570728006, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg197o/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_who_is_studying_abroad_for/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dg197o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 46, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg197o/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_who_is_studying_abroad_for/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570728007, "score": 148, "selftext": "I met my girlfriend a year ago and we've been head over heels about each other ever since.

However, the tough thing is that she's living abroad and it's quite complex for me to visit her often due to the cost of travelling and getting a time off from work. If the pregnancy continuous she will predictably have her entire pregnancy term where she lives right now and might even give birth in said country.

Packing my bags and moving to her is therefore very complex as my skills are so good as useless in another countries legal environment and I don't speak the language. In other words I would be hard pressed to find a job to financially support us. \n\nI don't really see what the right thing to do is in this situation. I want to raise this baby with her but leaving to move abroad would mean our financial situation when the baby is born won't be good, on the other hand, working during her pregnancy term and trying to save for the child's birth feels to me like I would be abandoning her during this period. She doesn't want to stop her studies so close to graduation and I support her in that. \n\nDoes anyone have any sound advice on how best to approach this situation ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2102207, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [26M] girlfriend [24F] who is studying abroad for the next 9 months, just told me she got a positive pregnancy test", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570814417, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg197o/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_who_is_studying_abroad_for/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "icebergelishious", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_p3xmi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570724150, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg0c24/my_roommate_is_spending_10_days_in_jail_how_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dg0c24", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 141, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg0c24/my_roommate_is_spending_10_days_in_jail_how_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570724151, "score": 387, "selftext": "My (22M) roommate (23M) had to serve some time for a cannabis vape thing.

This is going to sound awful, but I really can\u2019t stand being in public with him. \n\nWhy? He acts incredibly obnoxiously, and purposely finds ways to embarrass me. \n\nFor example, we recently went to the movies. He got nachos, and told me \u201cI\u2019m going to chew this as loudly as I can, especially during quiet parts.\u201d He knows it annoys me, which is why he does it. But he also knows it bothered the people around us, he didn\u2019t seem to care. He also talked (pretty loudly) to express his disbelief at a certain scene when the theatre was dead silent, and screamed whenever he saw the opportunity. \n\nWhenever we go out to eat, he\u2019s deliberately annoying towards staff. He constantly makes inappropriate jokes and comments, because according to him, that\u2019s \u201cjust his personality.\u201d Sometimes employees are receptive, but other times they visibly or verbally express their annoyance, which still doesn\u2019t lead him to stop. His sense of humor can be extremely condescending, and he doesn\u2019t seem to realize this. \n\nHe\u2019ll tell waitstaff and cashiers about whatever problem I have going on at the moment, which is his way of being funny. He knows I\u2019m shy, and will intentionally try to place me in a conversation with employees that is obviously very uncomfortable. \n\nAt a family party of mine, he demanded that I kiss him in front of everyone, even though I said no, to which he responded \u201cguess you don\u2019t love me, huh?\u201d He also got relatively drunk in front of my extended family, and struck up really inappropriate conversations about some of my family\u2019s personal matters. \n\nWhen I\u2019ve expressed to him that when he partakes in this behaviors, it sometimes embarrasses me, he\u2019s told me that I\u2019m being toxic and \u201cjust don\u2019t want him to be himself.\u201d That is not the case. There is a fine line between being funny and being disrespectful, and he crosses it nearly every time we go out. \n\nI will admit that I am a more reserved person, which I\u2019m working on. I\u2019m very shy and am actively trying to come out of my shell, but I do think he crosses the line very frequently. I don\u2019t know what to do, because every time I confront him, I\u2019m made to feel like a villain for bringing it up in the first place.

Husbands sister blew up at me at a family dinner saying that I was selfish and vain and probably cheating on my husband because I was so relieved my baby was dead and didn't mourn him properly. Advice on how to cope? \n\nHello everyone. Now I wish this was a troll post but unfortunately, it happened and I could really do with some advice please.\n\nHusband and I have been together for 5 years, married for 4. All relationships are work but we are so happy in love, our lives are/were great and we live very comfortably. \n\nOur son was stillborn 3 months ago and it has been the most monumental struggle ever since. For the first month I wasn't able to even process what was happening, I just went along my days as normal, housework, cooking, going outside for walks, going dutifully to the therapy sessions we set up. Emotionally though, I was just dead inside, I couldn't even sleep in the same bed as my husband, couldn't even process that there was a room in the house with our baby's things in there unused. For my husband, it was pure hell. I wouldn't talk to him about anything difficult and just tried to be some sort of perfect stepford housewife. Making the house beautiful and making sure there were hot meals and that I was focusing on losing the baby weight. So he spent all his time at work. I don't know why I did this, I think my brain just shut down and reverted to what it thought was a stable state. I had 9 months of maternity leave and I wasn't back at work anytime soon so I had nothing to focus my mind with. \n\nOf course it wasn't sustainable, ended up with me having a complete breakdown and we just hit rock bottom in so many ways. We've been clawing ourselves out of that ever since. Or attempting to. It seemed to be going alright, we talked everything out, weekly therapy sessions, my husband took a month off work and we just closed ourselves off from the world and just grieved together. I really thought we were going to be okay.\n\nThis previous Saturday, there was a family dinner at his parents place. It was the first time I'd been around his family since the funeral and a few visits in the first week after. I couldn't handle anyone being around me so they'd given me space and would just check in through text now and then.\n\nDuring the dinner, his sister was talking about her young kids and how well they were doing in school and their other activities. It was a little awkward honestly, I felt sick to my stomach but I didn't make any type of scene and just talked to her and complimented her kids and tried to just keep it really lovely and nice. After a while though, my husband asked if we could talk about something else backed up by his mum and his BIL. Sister got annoyed and asked why she couldn't talk about her kids, that I didn't seem to have any issue with it. \"obviously she doesn't care, so why should I have to stop talking about my sons?\". Husband quite firmly told her to stop and she just blew up. \n\nSaid that everyone knew I didn't care about the fact that my baby had died cos I had been going about my life as completely normal just days after the funeral. She said that I probably wanted him dead cos I was too vain to actually be a selfless mother. I was vain, obsessed with myself and my husbands money, a snob. (The fact that I worked out and ate very healthily during my pregnancy and didn't really gain any weight apart from my huge bump meant that I was selfish and who knows what I would've done to my child after he was here). Her husband and her parents told her stop but she just laughed and said that everyone had been talking about how shitty it was of me to not even mourn properly and the baby probably wasn't even my husbands. That's why I wasn't upset that he was gone, I wouldn't have to explain myself when my child ended up looking like someone else and not my husband. \n\nWe left immediately, I've never seen my husband so furious. I didn't know what to do or say and it's just been eating me up inside. I asked him if he'd thought I'd been selfish after the funeral by trying to act as if everything was okay and he just started crying and said that it was his fault that his family knew. He'd been so afraid for me and he'd confided in his parents who must have mentioned it to his sister. He said he didn't blame me at all for grieving like that, he was just heartbroken that he couldn't have been my rock during it.\n\nHis sister hasn't backed down, she sent him a pretty awful text message doubling down and has been talking to the rest of the family, gossiping about the dinner and telling them about what I'd been upto after the funeral and how I was so relieved I didn't have to be a mum.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up again.

She became consumed with this place. Devoting all her energy to it. When she was home away from the gym she would just sit on facebook or talk non stop about her trainer and her workouts. I was doing all the housework, working a 40 hour week, and practically being a single parent to our daughter. She has been depressed and down on her self about her weight for longer than that. Thus our relationship being distant, strained and not where it should be for years. A week ago we had a big falling out over things. Long story but here goes I guess. Almost a year and a half ago her personal trainer of about 3 months,  who is a male left her gym. She cried and got depressed and got in a funk. I immediately thought red flag. She said it was only because her \"fitness journey\" was coming to an end. I felt it was more than that. We argued for a couple days but I in the end believed her. He transferred to a gym an hour away. She immediately switched gyms and signed a year and a half contract at $100 a month at this gym farther away with this personal trainer. I was against it but she didn't care.  Now fast forward to a week ago. She brought up something about the gym and asked how i felt about everything. And all my insecurities came out and apparently she felt the need to let out a lot of things she was holding in. I asked her why she felt she needed him as a trainer. Foot notes of our 3 day conversation : He is positive when home life is negative. He is fresh and new. He is cute, at one point maybe she had a crush/feelings for him. He is dominate, controlling. Wants to make him proud. Energetic. Playful and flirty. Compliments her. Gives her attention. Bettering her. She can't workout for any other trainer, doesn't push as hard, doesnt want to. Etc. etc. Now home life is negative because I am stressed, strained, and carrying %100 of everything and have been begging for her help for years to no change. I am tired because of these things. I don't compliment her as much or try to motivate her because for years she has responded negatively to anything positive I have said. \"You look hot\" and she'd say \"no i dont your lying im fat and get mad\". This has been going on for a looong time. That is just one example. So I pretty much just stopped because I was trained to get a negative response. I stopped initiating sex. She would just turn me down or go off on her insecurities and ruin the mood. Now she says those feelings for him are gone. That they went away after he left her original gym. Kinda like a break up. The guy's fiance blocked my wife on his account on facebook because of the things my wife was messaging him. She said that made her realize maybe she was over stepping.  She says that now it is strictly about her \"fitness journey and he is the only trainer for her\" All of this broke my heart to know my wife felt this way and was getting fulfillment from another man while turning me away when I tried to do the very things he does. Because I felt she saw him as more than a personal trainer I came to the ultimatum \"The Gym and your trainer or Me\". She never backed down, she saw how bad I was hurt and agreed at one point she had a one sided emotional affair with this guy and still said she wasn't going to stop going or try new gyms or new trainers. She is still going to this gym and tells me isn't able to balance home, marriage, and the gym. And that her number one priority would be her needs and the gym over everything else.

We normally have him every second weekend, however, his mother was just running late at work and had to stay back a little longer at the hospital. So she asked my partner to fetch Jake from school. The plan was we were going to have him until 8pm and then she'd pick him up. \n\nAround 6pm came and we heard Jake let out a scream. He came running to me crying as I was going to his room to see what happened. His hand was just gushing blood. He was understandably hysterical. Our house is fairly old, but it has been done up. It still has those type of windows you lift up and down. It was windy and it somehow slammed shut in his hand. \n\nMy partner literally turned and ran back to the kitchen when he saw Jake's hand. At first I thought he was going to get the first aid kit. I told Jake to come with me to the kitchen. I look out the window and my partner is in the back on the garden staring off into the trees. I got a better look at Jake's hand and figured we better go to the hospital. \n\nI start calling my partner and he's ignoring me. I go outside to tell him we need to go, and he just started telling me he can't deal with blood and he'd stay here. I said that I didn't have time for this and took Jake to the hospital. He had to have stitches and a cast put on his hand. It was absolutely messed up. \n\nHis mother arrived and she noticed that his father wasn't there. She started to ask me where he was. Jake chimed in saying that his dad didn't come. She turned to me and asked what he was talking about. She then put it together that he didn't call her and I did. She noticed he wasn't there. To say she was angry was an understatement. \n\nMy partner is just kinda cowering now and he just keeps telling me that Mary is the paramedic. She can deal with gore and he can't. The problem is they never had a formal custody agreement because they were on such good terms, but now Mary is asking how she can trust he won't run away if Jake gets a worse injury because my partner feels sick at the sight of blood.

I live in a condo with my husband (30s) and my dog. My parents come from a Latin American country to visit us in Canada and I have always had a good relationship with them, this is the third time that they've come to visit us. I'm from Latin America, my husband is Canadian.\n\nWe have had a few issues with them when they've visited us before. When we go over there to visit them, we follow their house rules, eat whatever they offer us, don't complain about anything and are just grateful that they're having us. There's usually no friction when we're over there, we let them bicker between themselves (as they usually do), but we get to stay out of it. The issue happens when they come over to visit us in Canada.\n\nWhen they're here, they say that they're good with whatever, that they'll follow our rules, that they're just here to see us, etc - but they don't actually mean it. They'll complain about the food (in general, not our cooking), won't stop feeding my dog scraps (\"accidentally\" drop food for him, trying to feed him grapes even after I warned them that it's supposedly a dangerous food for dogs), won't take my word that they can't approach people and straight-up start talking to them in a foreign language... For example, my mother will usually just go to a cashier and start asking them questions in our language. I'm right there and able to translate, but she won't give me the chance. I've given up trying to stop her (she refuses and brushes me off, thinks that people can understand her), so I jump in preemptively and handle the whole transaction, so that the poor retail workers can see right away that there's someone in the group who speaks English.\n\nMy mother very obviously just wants to be right and say that everybody else is wrong. It doesn't matter what the subject is. Literal example: she tells my dad not to buy tomatoes at the farmers market today while we're walking by the stalls because she'd rather buy them at the supermarket (so that they don't get squished, presumably because the supermarket is closer to our home). So I ask her if she wants to go to the supermarket before we go home (as she did ask to buy tomatoes today), and she flips out saying that she never said anything about going to the supermarket. This sort of contradictory dialogue happens multiple times a day.\n\nHerding the two of them is really hard. My mother walks fast ahead of us, my father stays behind walking very slowly as he has MS. I end up in between them (as I'm 9 months pregnant and don't want to strain myself by walking too fast either, but can't lose sight of my mom who speaks almost zero English), trying to keep track of both of them. One of them getting lost for at least 5-10 minutes is a given every time we go out. Today my mother refused to wait for my father while embarking the subway (I asked her to wait and told her that the trains comes every 4 minutes, my dad was still on the escalator), so she ended up going in alone while I waited for my dad. That was fun. Thankfully she remembered what stop we were going to, since her cell phone isn't working here and we had no way to contact her. \n\nBoth of them have been uncooperative, my mother being the worst offender, and we still have 3 weeks to go. I'm mostly wondering if anyone has any experience in how to navigate this kind of situation somewhat smoothly, as this is really not the time for confrontation with the baby coming in a few days.

Anne and I have been dating for a little over an year now. I met her parents when we were 2 months together or so. She always spoke very highly of them and never mentioned any conflict that could have been the cause of the current issue. \n\nI've had some bad experiences with fathers in my past relationships but Anne's father was a nice surprise to have. He's a very cool dude and you can see he truly cares about his family and the happiness of every member. \n\nAfter I met her parents and got along with them, we would visit them at least twice a month. Sometimes it was Anne's idea and sometimes her parents would invite us to dinner with Anne's siblings. Once again, those were always positive experiences and both me and Anne enjoyed it.\n\n Then one day her father invited me to meet him so we could get some beer. I invited Anne but she didn't want to so I went by myself. He talked about his life, his job, random topics and I did the same. I had a pretty good time so when he invited me the next month I went again. So this became a thing, each month we meet up to drink beer and talk,\n\nAnne never said anything negative about this, in fact when I would come back she would ask if I had fun and we would talk a little bit about it. \n\nI was surprised three days ago to have her come and ask me to stop hanging out with her father. I asked if something had happened and she said that it didn't, she just wanted me to stop. This was something new because we usually talk about everything as openly as we can manage, it was something that we made sure to estabilish at the beginning due to our past experiences. So this is a very strange behavior coming from her. \n\nI tried asking her if they had argued or if he had said/done something to upset her but she changes the subject or flat out tells me to just stop hanging out with him and move on. I don't know if I should ask her father about this and to be honest it is not something that I want to do. Everything is normal unless I bring up this subject. Just today she was talking about her family planning the birthday of her sister next week and it was like nothing was happening. \n\nI don't want to make decisions without knowing what is going on behind them but I don't know how to get the answers without having to bring in more people into this.

I have only ever had sex with 2 guys besides him, and it was fairly tame stuff. When my fiance and I began having sex, it was also tame (but great!) for a time. After a while, we got more and more adventurous. He was especially helpful/patient/understanding/whatever to me about coming out of my shell and being more open to exploring. Since being with him he and I have learned many things about what I love, what I hate, and what I'm so-so about in the bedroom, and the same for him. \n\nHe's NEVER forced me to do anything I don't want to do. If I'm worried that something will hurt, or if I'm not sure about it, he will answer any questions or explain things I've been misinformed about. Most of the time, I'll try stuff out maybe once or twice to see if I like it. In the few times I've been the one to offer some ideas, he's done the same. Again, sometimes we like it, sometimes we don't. There's only been maybe two times where I've turned an idea down entirely and he took it in stride.\n\nA while back, though, while we were getting in the mood, he brought up the idea of a threesome.\n\nIt COMPLETELY caught me off guard since I was under the impression that, like me, he had no interest in stuff like this. We've sort of had conversations about it in the past - we were at a party and I noticed that someone there (I think she was like a friend of a friend of a friend's cousin to my fiance? Idk) was pretty casually affectionate to two different guys. My fiance explained that they were in a polyamorous relationship and - without being too judgmental or anything - he made an offhand comment about polyamorous relationships and open relationships not being his thing. I agreed. We moved on and I never thought back to it.  \n\nI asked why and he just said he thought it'd be hot, and that was all. I guess my shock was clear because he started explaining that it was just because he wanted us both to do something pleasurable, that he'd never have a threesome without me, that he wasn't trying to start a polyamorous thing, so on, so forth.\n\nI told him no, I wasn't interested. I wasn't interested in even trying it. He said okay, we moved on. I went to bed that night still bothered but willing to try to forget about.\n\nWell, he brought it up again. And again. And again. He stopped coaxing and had started begging.\n\nTwo days ago he brought it up again and we started arguing about it. He again tried to explain and justify and I kept shooting him down because I didn't see how any of his explanations mattered: I wasn't okay with it. So then he started getting accusatory. He'd done things I'd asked him to do before, so why couldn't I agree to this for him? Did I not believe him? I was usually so open-minded, why couldn't I just try it? I kept answering that A) there's a huge difference between positions/sex toys/bondage/etc. and *a third human being* joining us, and B) I don't want to do it because I feel sex should just be between us. It doesn't matter if he thinks it's just because it'll feel good, it'll bother me because I don't want to give and expose my body to anyone else but him.\n\nWhen I asked why he's so focused on *specifically* doing a threesome, he deflected the question. Now he's terse with me, will hardly talk about anything, and is pretty much pouting all around the house.\n\ntl;dr: Fiance wants to have a threesome for fun, it's outside of my comfort zone, he's very fixated on the idea and is being terse to me.

We met going to graduate school in PhD programs in different departments at the same university in a large American city. **We\u2019ve been together for about four and a half years**, and we\u2019ve lived together for about four (it was quick, but my apartment complex kicked out all month-to-monthers to renovate and raise prices). \n\nI'll be happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability.\n\n**TL;DR:** girlfriend struggles with bipolar 2, I probably struggle with adult ADD. We currently make about 42k/yr combined. She has been through a lot of painful stuff in life lately, and wants to make a $27k/yr commitment to buy horse because riding helps her a lot. I am trying to finish a PhD, she thinks I should also go get a job so we can afford this and it is my fault we aren't where we want to be in life now. She says she is going to buy the horse with or without me, without the income secured, and will figure it out later. I want us to secure the appropriate income first. We have long fought in a pattern that blames me entirely that seems very unhealthy and I feel harms me a lot and I don\u2019t know what to do to save this relationship/what to do next.\n\nWe\u2019ve been having very similar versions of a fight every one to three weeks for a very long time. The fight today that precipitated this post was pretty much exactly the same as the one we\u2019ve been having for the last few months, and the one where we had a big blow-up at each other yesterday. She wants to buy (maybe make payments for 12 months to buy) a $15,000 horse and pay upkeep costs of about $12,000/year, but I am in my last year of graduate school and she is recently no longer in graduate school (more on that later) and works part-time about 20 hours a week and we are just scraping by (if that\u2026) with living expenses on a combined total income right now of about $42,000/year. She has some one-time funds totaling about $15,000 received as basically inheritance/a nest-egg from her parents, but my position has long been that if we get to a point where we demonstrate a stable income that can spend half(ish) of our above-basic-costs income on the horse, that would be a responsible choice, but committing to and buying a horse before that point is deeply irresponsible and a big problem because we don\u2019t remotely have the money for that in terms of stable income right now, and spending one-time funds to fund the beginning of the commitment and hoping it works out is also irresponsible. Her anger at me for us not being in a position to do that right now or for me not being okay with just doing it anyway and hoping is right on the verge of ending our relationship, and it is the latest part in a saga of a much deeper problem that I just don\u2019t know what to do with or about, hence I am seeking advice about how to proceed.\n\nI really do apologize for how long this is going to be, and I appreciate anyone who finishes and has anything at all to say to me, because I could sure use it, so thank you in advance.\n\nSome background: she grew up on her parents\u2019 decent piece of land in the Midwest and rode horses competitively. She initially went to a university that was below her academic capability (she was valedictorian) and which she had some significant problems with (religious university and that mattered to them, all women) because she could continue to ride competitively for that university. After her freshman year, things weren\u2019t working out there and she transferred to a school further away, hoping she could ride for them, but for complex reasons that didn\u2019t actually work out and she kind of had to give up on that earlier than she wanted, and it was something that brought a lot of meaning and well-being to her life from a young age. In general, life with and around animals and caring for animals is a huge part of her and the best candidate for what brings her satisfaction and how she can spend her life and feel satisfied and engaged. She came to graduate school wanting to involve animal studies (how we think about and relate to them in our culture) and eventually work her way back to working with animals/educating people about them and probably work her way back to her midwestern roots. \n\nHowever, her graduate school department was rife with shitty internal personal politics that divided things up into factions and screwed students over at every step. Her advisor sexually harassed her, made her work environment hostile, and leveraged her (the advisor\u2019s) position as gatekeeper of professional opportunities to get girlfriend to do personal work and errands for little or no pay. Girlfriend reported this to the department chair and the Title IX office on campus, department chair initially said nothing could be done, but girlfriend was eventually let out from under that advisor under pressure from Title IX office. However the department chair immediately installed herself as the new advisor and railroaded girlfriend out of the university entirely, failing her for successive semesters while not engaging with her work at all and giving her no good-faith chance to succeed. A grievance was filed, denied, appealed, denied again because university is treating department chair\u2019s word as more authoritative than dozens of emails submitted as evidence of railroading (\u201cwrite a whole dissertation chapter per week and I won\u2019t read or comment unless it is perfect,\u201d etc). There is one more level of internal appeal to the university president possible, and the Title IX office is in turmoil for mishandling other stuff on campus but could in theory continue with her case pending her re-engaging there, but she\u2019s having a lot of trouble bringing herself back to dealing with either process because of the trauma and because everyone on the university side has been incredibly shitty through the whole thing and it seems they just don\u2019t give a shit about doing the right thing/students. \n\nAnother thing to know, she has been having some mental health struggles for our entire relationship. This didn\u2019t bother or scare me, because I had some serious mental health issues earlier in my life and some focused cognitive behavioral therapy did a lot for me to redirect me very much for the better in life, and we all have our \u201cissues\u201d and our challenges, recognized or not, and that\u2019s part of being in a relationship with a real person. She was being treated with prescription medication for depression. She deals with a lot of anxiety and anger issues. Initially she saw a therapist through school, but she came to feel that there was no progress being made there and he made comments she felt were inappropriate (I agree, based on what she said). She\u2019s been to two more since then. They haven\u2019t worked out and she currently isn\u2019t seeing anyone for therapy for the last several months. She says at this point a major issue is finding someone else in our insurance network (I get insurance through school and added her as a dependent). She does have somewhat-regular 15-minute-ish check-ins monthly or so with a doctor who prescribes medications. She is presently being treated with that medication under a bipolar (type-2) disorder diagnosis. \n\nOver the course of the latter half of graduate school, I have struggled a lot. I had two real pillars of support for the first half in the form of other people, two genuinely great friends. One died of cancer while in the middle of school and the other one moved across the country to live with her boyfriend where he got into school. I have discovered a lot about myself as I have needed now two extra one-year extensions beyond the initial planned time to finish. My first advisor didn\u2019t work out for entirely professional, no-hard-feelings, approach-to-the-work reason. I was able to change advisors to someone who is stylistically much more suited to me when I received the first year extension, but that did set progress back quite a bit. I have learned that I probably have undiagnosed and untreated adult ADD or ADHD. I bought a couple books about it, and it really seems on point for being a big part of the way I have struggled to be as productive as I want to be and I should be. \n\nShe started to work at a local (horse-) riding program as a part-time instructor about a year and a half ago, before the harassment inquiry and subsequent railroading got really out of hand. She told we she was seeking a once or twice a week a couple hours each day gig to get back in touch with horses for the mental health benefit and because she would enjoy that. I was for that, because it seemed it very healthy and worth encouraging, so long as it didn\u2019t overcome the other stuff she had to do in life. But now, having been forced from graduate school, that is now her source of income, and she works there about 20 hours per week but doesn\u2019t make nearly what she should for the level of skill involved -- at present it\u2019s about $20k/year.\n\nAround the same time when we were both in grad school and in need of more money, we started petsitting from home. She had three dogs when I moved in that got along well with my cat and it using a popular online home-sitter-listing service was a good way of getting us some extra money through having people pay us to watch their dogs for daycares or longer stays. We eventually became pretty successful at it, until one neighbor moved out and the new neighbors (these are smaller rental houses in a neighborhood) just didn\u2019t like it (we kept it quiet, only took calm dogs, never left them outside unsupervised, etc) and reported us directly to the city, including our web profile. We had to shut down the web stuff because our city has a blanket ban on caring for pets you don\u2019t own for money. We still have a few regular clients we handle under the table, but it doesn\u2019t bring in what it used to. It brings in about $10k/year right now.\n\nI still get a small amount of money for being in school, worth about $12k/year, so fast forward to now and we are starting to face up to serious financial danger renting our house in a nice neighborhood she and her parents insisted on staying in with a total household income of about $42k/year. As I said earlier, she wants to either buy outright or commit to a 12-month payment schedule on a $15,000 horse, which will then cost another $12,000/year to house/care for at a minimum. She wants to start all this by using a total of about $15,000 she received from her parents after some property sales intended for savings, and then \u201csurely\u201d we\u2019ll be in a position to afford it stably after that. \n\nI would say since about six months into the relationship or so we have always had some verbal fights about some things. At first they were only once every month or two, and they weren\u2019t as bad. At first they were about some of my bad habits; I am generally much more messy at home than I should be. Leaving things out in the kitchen. Leaving things out on the coffee table or the kitchen table. Leaving laundry on the floor on my side of the bed. I sort of struggle to see messes the same way that she does, and we have discussed how much it helps her. I try to be better, for a while she was actually encouraging of me and it got slowly better, but I still need to be better. \n\nAs the relationship went on, they got worse and more frequent. Then a financial squeeze started to set in and we needed some more income. I have a lot of trouble focusing on enough stuff in one day to work part-time and work on my dissertation. I have taught for my university before, and on teaching days the teaching kind of consumes me against my will. It is a part of probably having ADD. We settled on a combination of the dog-sitting at-home business, which I struggled with at first but got much better with, and she went out and sought some part-time teaching stuff (this is before the barn). We fought about money. She felt it was unfair she was doing more. I tried to take things off her plate. I offered to completely take over the dog-sitting arrangements. I tried to do so and I kept us booked full at our maximum capacity, but it quickly wasn\u2019t enough for her and she chose to take it back over to send even more messages and pictures and blamed me for not doing enough. Not sending tons of messages and pictures and being really over the top with it was something she had a lot of uncontrollable anxiety about, even though I had kept customer relations good and kept us booked at capacity. She blamed me for not doing \u201cmy job\u201d or doing enough. I suggested she should look into a teaching gig at another small local university. She accepted the gig and hated it. I offered to grade for her. I offered to write up lesson plans for her and post them online on the course site. I offered to do everything I could to help her get through the term and take as much work as possible off her plate. She wouldn\u2019t let me. She blamed me for \u201cmaking\u201d her take the job, where what we had was a calm reasonable discussion and mutually decided the money was worth it.\n\nThen not long after starting work at the barn, the issue of the horse started to come up. I resisted because we couldn\u2019t afford it. We can\u2019t even afford the pure upkeep costs of $12,000/yr (yes, that\u2019s what it costs to board a horse at a barn/stables). We fought about this then. At the same time, one of our regular dog-sitting clients, a puppy, found itself in need of a new home because the owners\u2019 couldn\u2019t handle her. Girlfriend begged and begged me to adopt her. We already had the city\u2019s legal limit worth of dogs, and one more would be against code. And we were running a dog sitting service that was also technically against city rules. Adopting this dog put that income we needed in further jeopardy. I resisted adopting this dog because it would therefore be irresponsible. We fought about it a lot. I didn\u2019t ask for this, but she said many times if we adopted the dog she\u2019d give up on the horse quest. Eventually I just couldn\u2019t take the fighting anymore so I relented. We adopted the dog. The dog is a very vocal beagle, and honestly the most likely thing that pissed off our new neighbors enough to report us to the city and get the business mostly shut down was her noisy barking in our yard. But I do love the dog and she is a part of our family now and that all ended well. The quest for the horse resumed by April. \n\nSo what is on my plate that I am struggling with is making fast enough progress on the PhD to finish by May and getting a part-time job to help us out more. I want to do these things, but it is genuinely difficult in life. I want to do these things and I try, I try to sit and focus and do work, but I also feel that the atmosphere of this relationship and this household for the last several months has become a real hinderance. I will explain more about that and how I think that has a lot to do with my failures to succeed at these two things on my plate when I give a long list of some of what has gone on in two paragraphs\u2019 time. \n\nAt this point she is flat-out insisting on making the $27k commitment to the horse by the end of this week, and I am trying to say that it would be irresponsible of us to make that commitment right now. My position has always been that we should focus on fixing our other problems to make us both more productive and happy so that we can go get ourselves the jobs to glue together the income to where this expenditure is reasonable, and once we demonstrate that level of income is stable with a month of paychecks at that rate, then we can go horse shopping. So she can pick up a second part-time gig dog-walking and I can get my dissertation under control for a few weeks and then go get a tutoring gig and maybe in two months or so we can be in a position to spend a lot more money once we know where we are. She says she won\u2019t wait and is going to do this with or without me.\n\nBut a lot more than just this concerns me regarding our fights and our relationship. At this point there\u2019s no coherent narrative way to describe all the features I mean, so I will just list them. Sorry this is such a mess:\n\n\\-We always discuss what I\u2019m not doing, or what is happening that isn\u2019t good and what I need to do to change it. She expresses a lot of frustration with me.\n\n\\-She brings up and lists my shortcomings, what I\u2019m not doing. She accuses me of being lazy. She says I am just using her. She says she doesn\u2019t trust me. She says that I never deliver (because I have problems being as productive as I should be and I don\u2019t currently have a part-time job in addition to trying to finish a dissertation as a full-time student probably with ADD). She says I am a slob. She says I don\u2019t care. She says I should have finished my degree years ago. She says she will never be okay with it/me if I don\u2019t finish. She has said before when asked that yes, she does feel like I am the one holding her back from the life she wants and that I have been for four years. She said at one point she didn\u2019t think I would be a good father (though she doesn\u2019t want children). She says about my struggles and my not-big-enough steps to try and move toward addressing it that \u201cshe\u2019s been hearing that for years\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s pushing me to get a move on,\u201d \u201cWhat push will it finally take to get you to see/be better?\u201d Things like that.\n\n\\-I always try to de-escalate and it doesn\u2019t work. I try to ask to talk about this later, and she just continues with the fight now. In one of our last fights, as I asked twelve times for her to please stop. The first six times I asked were very calm, after which I increasingly felt panic and hurt set in and had less and less control until I was yelling. I have thrown objects in frustration before, which I should not have done. But I ask her to stop and she just keeps going. It is very difficult to listen to.\n\n\\-I recognize and apologize for my failures and shortcomings, but we just keep discussing what I am not doing as the problem.\n\n\\-She says she isn\u2019t doing this and saying all of these things to hurt me, but is continuing on with my flaws and shortcomings and her anger about them \u201cbecause they are facts\u201d and accuses me of not wanting to deal with the truth, says it is my fault for being upset by this.\n\n\\-She says I don\u2019t do enough to get better. I do want to be better. I mentioned trying to make small steps in the right direction, like buying a book about the condition and reading it as a way of working toward accepting more therapy. She says this isn\u2019t good enough, yells at me that I need therapy right now.\n\n\\-She brings up over and over that I don\u2019t keep my word because I struggled to make progress fast enough. I think this is undercutting and would rather she support me.\n\n\\-She thinks I am wrong for seeing her cataloging my failures in every fight to talk about what I am not doing and haven\u2019t done that means she can\u2019t have the horse (or whatever) as her being undercutting. Says I am the one perceiving it that way. She is just \u201cstating facts.\u201d\n\n\\-In life, I have asked that we try to encourage even small steps in the right direction as a way of building momentum to being better and taking bigger steps. She very much struggles with actually being encouraging. She responds to my reporting what good thing I did by suggesting more I could do. I need to be physically healthier, so I make something to eat healthier than usual. She suggests I take things out to make it better. I cleaned the kitchen without us discussing it, and while I understand that doesn\u2019t deserve a medal, she commented about what wasn\u2019t done well enough. I tried to explain that I do much better contributing and doing things for us when I feel like I am in control and not being tasked to do so as a condition of her/us being okay, to feel like I have some pride of ownership of my efforts. As soon as the kitchen got messy again, she got angry about it and admitted that she was \u201cwaiting for me to do it\u201d and kept checking in on if I had done it yet. That kind of thing happens a lot, and it makes me feel like a child or like someone living with his boss who sets tasks and timetables, not a loving and supportive partner.   \n\n\\-I bought a bike to be healthy. I shopped and researched for months. I need to lose weight and be healthier. I bought a $1,200 bike on credit. I ride it some, though at times she has guilt tripped me into not going for rides because she is upset and feeling down about everything in life. I screwed up big and missed some payments. I owe some interest now. I screwed up but its a fixable amount of money. She brings it up every time we fight about the horse now as an irresponsible expenditure. It was $1,200, or less than 5% the cost of the horse and a year of care.\n\n\\----END of PART 1----- I'll post the rest as a comment....", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2100151, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (32m) girlfriend (29f) struggles with mental health and is insisting on spending $27k/yr on a horse for her well-being.

It turns out my girlfriend of two years has been cheating on me for at least four months. For a relationship that had been through so much, I thought we were able to overcome some of the low points. Together we were able to overcome that she has a child from a previous relationship and the embarrassing fact that I had to get a prescription from forhims (I\u2019m only 25).To the point that she even started letting me leave it at her place (which is problematic now because my last three boxes are still at her place). \n\nA few months ago she explained to me that she was going to have to be traveling a lot more for work, and while she was upset about it, it was ultimately going to be a great opportunity for her to get another promotion. I too was a bit upset about this since I had just moved into her apartment and got a dog together. None the less I was still happy and supporting of the fact she was working towards a promotion. \n\nAs she started to travel I was getting a little jealous of my girlfriend as she got to travel to DC, Miami, and Chicago in a 6 week this summer. On top of that when she was in DC and Chicago she got to go to Wrigley and see the nationals play. She said the clients that she was seeing had taken her to the games. These seats that she was getting weren\u2019t bad either. For the game at Wrigley field she even got to sit behind homeplate. \n\nThis is was an exciting time for both of us. She was doing great in work, we had an adorable dog together, and when she would get back from the road the sex was unbelievable. Nothing was out of bounds, there were no safe words. To say that we experimented with each other\u2019s bodies was an understatement. She opened me up and exposed me to things I would have never considered like being pegging (It is shockingly empowering). \n\nI didn\u2019t really feel like anything was amiss until she went on her trip to Miami for work. In the entire build up to her leaving that Monday it was like we were in the honeymoon phase of our relationship again. We hardly left the apartment all week, let alone bed. We were in the throes of passion it was pure bliss. \n\nThis was the longest trip she was going to be taking. She was going to be gone Monday to Friday. Typically she would be traveling for only a few days at a time. She was gone that Monday morning before I woke up, taking an uber to the airport, I just had a single text from her \u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get settled\u201d with a heart emoji. \n\nThe two of us are in constant contact like true millennials nothing we do; we don\u2019t not share with each other. So it was a little alarming when she went radio silent for the first two days of her trip. I was in a pure panic. Did something happen to her? Should I be worried? Do I need to call her parents, the police? I was wondering if I should even travel down there to go see if she was okay. \n\nThankfully sanity prevailed and I didn\u2019t go in search of her, and in her own time she finally responded and explained how busy she was the first day. And that she had unexpectedly seen some friends from college on the second night.  All was back to being right in the world, and the rest of her time away went by without a hitch. Needless to say I was thrilled for her to come back.\n\nAs the door to our apartment opened and she came in looking like her beautiful just more tan self I was instantly smitten. I rushed over to giver her a kiss, and she turned her head to the side and my lips ended buried in her hair. Weird I thought but maybe she is just tired it was a long day after all. \n\nThe rest of the evening continued with this theme of her being distant and distracted by her phone. This wasn\u2019t the girl that I had known and fallen in love with after swiping right on her tinder profile two years ago. As she went to our dog Lang out for walk, she left her phone out on the kitchen table. I am not proud of what I did next but I unlocked her phone and started to snoop. \n\nWhat I found was earth shattering. Turns out the travel was not work related at all, she had a sugar daddy that she meet on internet. She was traveling with a very well-off lawyer and going to all of these events with him. Her texts with him read like pure smut. It was degrading and vile. It was clear that she no longer loved me. \n\nHer and the dog returned and I asked her if we could have a conversation. She sat down on the couch and I took a seat next from her and I ask her to explain who \u201cLaurence\u201d is. She immediately went pale, and her bottom lip started to quiver. Through stammering and tears she tried to explain that they didn't have sex. But she would let him grind on her butt until he came and one time she gave him a handjob. \n\nShe went on to try and explain all of this was to pay for her bills and pay for things for her kid. The kid isn't in her life a lot because the dad has majority custody but she still pays for things for him. Even though they didn't have Sex, and she viewed it as purely a transaction, I still feel like I can never trust her again. The only words I could muster were \u201cPeyton how could you do this to me\u201d. Not a lot of words were said after that as I quickly grabbed a few things and Lang.\n\nI currently sit here writing this back at my mom\u2019s. I packed un small bag of stuff and I brought the dog and his toys. I haven\u2019t really talked to her since and she hasn\u2019t really gone out of her way to contact me, which leads me to believe what I know that she thinks this is over.\n\nI know this may be crazy to write but I still love her. Should I try and work this out with her? Do you guys think it's cheating if she saw it as a transaction and something she had to do to provide?\n\nTL:DR: My girlfriend of two years found an internet celebrity sugar daddy and starting cheating on me with him and I caught her.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2099229, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (M25) caught my GF (F25) of two years cheating but she doesn't think it's cheating.

We\u2019ve lived together for almost 1 year, where I moved out of state for him after he left for a job (I got a great job at least). \n\nAbout 4 months after he moved away, where I had been driving the 2 hours to visit him every other weekend, he started acting suspicious (hiding his phone while texting while I\u2019m sitting next to him on the couch, the typical stuff) so the day I was leaving to go home I went through his phone while he was in the bathroom. Found messages on his Facebook spanning a little over a week to one of his female coworkers where he was sending her hearts, asking to hang out (the night that we were on the couch together he\u2019d made plans get drinks with her but he \u201ccanceled\u201d saying he was tired, opting to send her a picture of him in the bathroom in his pjs while I\u2019m sitting oblivious in the other room) and proof that they DID hang out one night to get high til almost 1am! Cherry on top, she was married!\n\nOf course I confront him on this, but there\u2019s no time to talk because he has to go to work and I have to drive back to my home state. He just hugs me, tells me it\u2019s nothing, and that he doesn\u2019t want that to ruin my day (spoiler: it did) The long short of this part is I contacted the husband, the woman contacted me saying nothing happened between my boyfriend and her, and how she was just being friendly. The husband was not too happy over my boyfriends behavior. My boyfriend apologized over and over, promised to be better and never to do anything like that again after \u201cseeing how much it hurt me\u201d,  and hung his head in shame. Despite the advice from everyone I knew, I was head over heels for this guy and said I was willing to give him one more chance, but if it ever happened again that there wouldn\u2019t even be a discussion and I would be gone. \n\nFlash forward to September, and one evening while I\u2019m home alone, I decided to go through his phone again just to see. He\u2019d recently upgraded to a new phone (the Friday before this happened) and his old one was sitting on the floor of our bedroom. What I found was, of course, the worst case scenario. Facebook messages to more female coworkers talking about who they have \u201ccrushes\u201d on in the work place, plans to go out in the city, my SO asking these female coworkers to hang out and smoke with him (clearly this is his play) saying that he\u2019s been \u201cwanting to smoke with them for almost 2 years,\u201d bro talk with male coworkers about who they think are hot and who they want to fuck, etc. Not really the stuff you want to read when you already have trust issues with your boyfriend! \n\nAnd in his recent texts I found text messages from a contact only named \u201cP$.\u201d The messages read as if I was reading the texts between a regular couple. But this MY boyfriend talking like this to someone else. The girl my boyfriend was so happy to talk to wasn\u2019t me. He was calling her \u201csunshine\u201d and \u201cmi amor,\u201d asking about how her day has been, how her dog is, and she even FaceTimed him in the morning one day! It was awful to read. I reached out to P$ to ask if she knew that this guy she was taking to had a girlfriend he lived with. She immediately lied and said she just had his Snapchat (even though I had texted her?), but that they had met at a concert THREE YEARS AGO in a different state and hadn\u2019t met since. She then said to me that she \u201chad a vague idea about me\u201d (they were friends on Facebook and he and I were \u2018Facebook official\u2019) and that my boyfriend has just said we lived in the same state, all the while acting like he was planning on dating her. \n\nWhen my boyfriend came home I confronted him with everything. He admitted to having been talking to this girl since 2016, but that it wasn\u2019t \u201ca thing\u201d and that \u201cit happened sporadically. \u201d He got defensive, angry, then apologetic and sad. He said would change, he would do better, it was nothing. It was just to boost his ego, he just feels the \u201cuncontrollable need for attention.\u201d  All the same shit I had heard before. He said he\u2019ll get into therapy to figure out why he acts this way, but wanted me to set it all up. He says it\u2019s not cheating because nothing physical happened, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the position to say what is and isn\u2019t cheating, especially since I had already made it clear that what he did last year I considered cheating. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck living with a guy that has caused me TWO heartbreaks. He wants another chance to make it work of course, but I feel like he\u2019s shown his stripes and has kept showing his stripes even after his more recent betrayal came to light. He refused to sleep on the couch after a week, said I could sleep there if I didn\u2019t want to sleep with him, and has just generally been the same selfish asshole I\u2019m starting to realize he\u2019s always been. The saying \u201conce a cheater always a cheater\u201d really may be true because he had told me he\u2019d cheated on his last girlfriend (actually slept with someone) and was actually attempting to talk to ME while he was with her (I didn\u2019t know this at the time as I was with someone else and this before we actually got together but I should\u2019ve seen the glaring red flag).  \n\nOur lease is up at the end of the month, and I told him I want us to find our own apartments. This would be a bit of a financial strain on both of us, since we have been very comfortable in our current living situation. He\u2019s probably been even more comfortable as he had often used my financial stability to borrow money when he was short for bills.  \n\n\nTL/DR : my boyfriend has cheated on me multiple times (all through the phone) and I\u2019m moving out on him, which will cause a financial strain on me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2099160, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Caught my SO flirting/texting with other women... for the 2nd time.

My friend and I have been friends since grade 11, we re now almost 30. Approximately 6 months ago, I was starting to look for my own place and spoke with a realtor who connected me with a mortgage broker. I gave the broker all the documents etc for my approval.  2 months later, my friend told me she bought a house and didnt tell me she was looking or anything, so it was a surprise. Then she told me she was becoming a mortgage specialist as well. So over the summer I wasn\u2019t actively looking for a place but a couple weeks ago one came up that I liked so I put an offer and it was accepted. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem, since the original broker had my information I simply continued working with him. I also didn\u2019t want to risk any problems with the friendship, for example if I went with her and the rates were higher and I decided to\nGo with someone else I didn\u2019t want there to be issues. So, I told her the news last night over dinner and I understand if she was a little upset that I didn\u2019t work with her, but she lost it on me. She told me I just don\u2019t give a shit\u201d and that I\u2019m making excuses and was very angry that I didn\u2019t work with her. She was raising her voice in the bar saying \u201cyou knew I\u2019ve been doing this for 4 months\u201d  I explained that I wasn\u2019t trying to offend her or upset her but I was working with someone already before she entered this field and I didn\u2019t want to complicate business with friends etc and she was not understanding at all. I also thought me being honest and talking face to face would have been better than just keeping it to myself.

I told the kids--that was tough.  Have to wait 120 days for the final hearing.  In the meantime, I am living in the basement at my choice...too much \"marriage stuff\" upstairs. Things with the STBX have been very awkward and frustrating, but I am dealing.   I realized I needed to let go of my hate and anger towards her to move forward.  I just tell myself that my wife has died and that the person living in the house is just a roommate. \n\n In some sense, I feel really badly for her, as she seems to recognize the gravity of what she did and seems truly sorry.  She keeps trying to re-engage with me...to get some reaction.  She cries a lot. I have been a solidly \"pleasant oak.\"  I smile and say ok.  If I disagree I just say so and that we need to find an alternative. Most communication is by text about logistics.  Trying not to tip the apple cart before things are finalized. Getting angry won't make anything better and will only make things worse. \n\nWe still do \"family\" movie night. Birthday parties with relatives has been really tough, but I hold my head up high. I've stopped drinking (not that it was a problem before), started exercising again, lost weight, and regularly hit the gym.  \n\nHonestly, while I am very very \"sad\" I lost my family, I feel free.  I am living life for me and my kids now.  \n\nThe conversations with the kids are the worst and most guilt-tripping. They don't understand and are so upset.  All they know is that \"mommy and daddy don't get along anymore\" and that \"mommy made a mistake.\"---she said that, not me.   \nThe worst is from my son who is in a parochial school and keeps telling me that \"whatever mom did, you have to forgive her; God forgives everyone.\"   Also, the \"am I going to get a new mommy\" questions are so tough.\n\nI have zero interest in pursuing a relationship with anyone again, and don't think I ever will.  I don't need another person to be happy or fulfilled. \n\nI don't plan on any further updates unless something significantly changes.\n\nThanks for all the thoughts/advice.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMomento mori", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2098775, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wife cheated...now what?

I get along with everyone in the office and see some of them outside the office quite regularly.\n\nEveryone in my company fills out a year end work review. You rate yourself and write why. I've had a pretty tough year with a lot of learning and growth in my job so I was looking forward to getting feedback on what to concentrate on, where I could improve, etc. And I wanted to talk about future goals. I put a lot of time and consideration into my review and submitted it on time. \n\nTwo months came and went. My coworkers had all done their reviews so I wrote my manager an email and asked if we could go over my year end review. He replied we could do it that afternoon and another manager (33f) would be sitting in on the meeting. Weird, but sometimes I do work for her, I thought maybe she had feedback.\n\nThe first thing my manager said when I pulled out my printed review was he didn't read it. Odd. I had a list of questions, things I'd never officially been taught and wanted clarification on like how to enter my time, how bonuses worked, etc. After I was doney questions I just sat there staring at them. Like if they hadn't read my review what we're we going to talk about.\n\nThe next hour was my boss going over why I wasn't a great employee. None of which had to do with my actual work. The three main points were that I was whiny, emotionally manipulative  and entitled. The examples (and there were a lot of them leading back for months) seemed mostly like he mistook my intentions or was taking something I said out of context. Miscommunication, but only because he was taking something I said and twisting it. \n\nExample, I asked (in email) if I could go to a tech conference that specializes in a program I work with. When he didn't reply I followed up saying why I thought I should go. He said \"conferences aren't a free vacation, you have to actually do work\". I just replied \"wow\" and dropped it. I later told him in person that hurt my feelings and said I wouldn't be asking to attend any other conferences. He used that example as me acting entitled. I said I wasn't upset he'd said no, but I didn't like how I was being treated. He didn't budge, I was acting like I had a right to go.\n\nOne example that really hurt my feelings was a personal conversation we'd had where I'd talked to him in his office. I was upset, but not crying. He brought it up in front of the other manager and said the only reason we had the conversation was because I was trying to manipulate him into getting a raise. I was so embarrassed and caught off guard. I did get a raise this year and now you're telling me it wasn't because of all the work I do, but because I we'd had a conversation and I was upset?\n\nThis went on for an hour. The other manager didnt say much, but it seed like they'd talked about me a lot over the past few months. She'd read emails and texts sent to my manager from me. One thing she said was that I needed better communication and my emails came off as passive-aggressive. The only thing I can think of is when I text \"wow\" in reply to my manager accusing me of wanting a free vacation, otherwise I make a point of trying to be informative and professional in my emails.\n\nThroughout the meeting I was told repeatedly not to cry, take things personally and over all to be less emotional. For the record I was so shocked I didn't cry or even get upset. I didn't really do anything but listen.\n\nOther than \"be less passive aggressive in emails\" there wasn't any actual feedback on improving my work or even these complaints. It was just a long rant about why my manager doesnt like me.\n\nI have had a hard time this year with my job and manager. I didn't have a place to live between apartments for a couple months and was commuting hours to get to our office. I'm in a field I know nothing about and my job changed from graphic design (qualified) to sales support and marketing (no experience in either) so there's been a huge learning curve. I thought I was doing really well though. \n\nMy manager isn't great with people. His patience is short, he can be mean, he'll get upset if I don't know enough about something or I've forgotten something he said months before. I've felt really stupid and put down a lot this year, but I just brushed it off or if something was bothering me i would try to talk to him or a colleague about how to approach it. \n\nAnd I don't want to sugar coat everything I do. I have adhd and part of that is having a wider range of emotions than most. I can take things more personally than they're meant. I know this about myself so if I feel hurt by someone I try to brush it off or talk to them about it, even to just clarify things. I really wouldn't have said I'm overly emotional at work, but maybe that's what he meant by whiny? I also have a short memory, but I write everything down and have good work around in place for it.\n\nI guess my question is about moving past what happened. I feel so uncomfortable and embarrassed. I tried to talk to HR and they told me if I choose I can change managers (to the other woman that was in the meeting). HR told me not to talk to manager about it, which I don't deal well with. If I'm upset at someone I want to talk about it or never talk to them again. Also do I even want to stay at a job with a manager who is going to hold grudges against me for months on end? \n\nWhat do I do here reddit. \n\nTl;dr had a poor year end review.

Sorry for the throwaway, but as you read the story, it will be fairly clear why I\u2019d rather not have my real account attached to this. \n\nMy (M32) wife (28) of three years has been living some sort of on-line double life that came crashing down today and I don\u2019t think I can ever look at her the same way again. It\u2019s going to take a bit of background, so buckle up. I was called into my boss\u2019s office yesterday and presented with a printout of my reddit post history with a ton of posts highlighted. Nothing problematic, but a lot of them were made on company time, so I was let go from my position immediately. I have only ever posted on my phone using data, never the company wifi, so I was stunned how they would even know what my account was or what I was doing. I was too shocked to even ask further questions, I just packed up my stuff and got out of there.\n\nI got home from work and immediately told my wife what happened, and she looked like she was caught in the middle of committing murder. I asked her what was wrong and tried to assure her we\u2019d be ok, my savings could carry us through until I find more work. She\u2019s a SAHM with our 2 year old daughter, so I assumed she was frightened for our future. I was honestly expecting her to yell at me a bit for getting fired over something so stupid, but she pretty much just stayed silent. \n\nShe was still acting weird as we were getting ready for bed, so I asked her what was wrong again. She says it\u2019s her fault and immediately breaks down sobbing. I had no idea what she was talking about. After trying to calm her down, she tells me its her fault my post history was sent to my boss. She tells me it\u2019s from an \u201cinternet fight on reddit\u201d she\u2019s been involved in. I don\u2019t know what this means so I make her sit down and explain all of this. This is where things get weird and I\u2019m still not even sure about all of it.\n\nAbout two years ago, my wife started participating in some subreddit about a lifestyle blog she liked. As time went on, she got more and more involved. She also began posting antagonistically toward other frequent users. Eventually, she was banned a few months ago. She then joined a discord server about that same blog and began trying to get revenge on the users she had arguments with in the past on the subreddit.\n\nShe created multiple burner accounts to spam the subreddit and to report other users to try to get them banned. I still don\u2019t know how all of this worked, I just use reddit for a few sports subs so I\u2019m not too familiar with all of this. People on the subreddit started making fun of her for all of her trolling attempts, so she started doxing them. I\u2019ve seen the posts and messages. Full-on doxing, names, personal info. My wife has sent messages to their family and people that they work with. Things that I cant confirm if they were true or not but she was threatening with cheating accusations, vile sexual stories in which she claimed to be the mistress. \n\nToday she was doxxed in retaliation, which somehow ended up with me doxxed and the situation I\u2019m in today. She\u2019s always been a normal girl, she\u2019s the love of my life and the mother of my child, but she\u2019s an insane person on the internet. Looking at some of this shit and hearing her talk about it like its completely normal, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve never even met this person before. Please just help me figure out what I should be doing moving forward. I already printed out a lot of the posts and am with my daughter at my parents house for the night.\n\nTL:DR: I got fired from my job for reddit posts.

He has been amazing, taking care of me and driving me around, I will be forever grateful to him. \n\nI don't know how long it will take for me to stop feeling like shit, and honestly I don't even know if I want to go back to the police station and say what happened for the millionth time, but at least I am out of that situation.\n\nI am still confused and don't know how to feel. I know it's horrible to say but I still love him. He's been calling and texting me.

TL;DR is basically what the title says. On mobile, so don\u2019t mind my wacky formatting. I don\u2019t even know where to begin because I still can\u2019t comprehend the fact that this situation is real. \n\nSo to summarize, from the beginning of September up until last week my boyfriend (bf) and mother had sex on 10 separate occasions, including once on vacation as I slept in the other room. My mother, my bf and myself have lived together for the past 5 years of our relationship. We had (what I thought) was a great relationship. As a preface, my bf was orphaned at a young age and my mom took him in when we started dating and loved him from the beginning. They have always had a close, familial relationship, and would often hang out together in a mother-son type manner that would\u2019ve never raised any suspicions. The affair supposedly only took place over the course of about a month and this all came to light less than 72 hours ago. \n\nAccording to my bf, this all began this April on a vacation the three of us took with my boyfriends family for a wedding. His brother inquired about the way my mother looked and acted around my bf, basically insinuating that the three of us were in a relationship. Obviously at that point he denied it fervently because nothing happened, but it sparked a curiosity that he would apparently ponder on for months before finally acting on it. \n\nMy bf began acting strangely, picking more petty fights and giving less attention to my feelings and our relationship in general. We\u2019ve never been the type of couple to argue, but we started having various arguments that were extremely escalated to the point we would start to get physical. I would even comment mid-fight about the unnecessary escalation and the strange behavior my bf had been exhibiting. All his friends will tell you that whenever he has something that is bothering him, this his standard reaction until he finally admits what his real problem is. Little did I know he was deflecting his cheating shame. This is one example of the many communication issues we had. \n\nAnyways, I know this is a huge breach of trust but his strange behavior led me to look through his phone and I found a good amount of damning evidence. I confronted him and gave him a chance to speak the truth, but he pussyfooted and refused to say much other than a meek apology. He even went as far as to say he \u201cDidn\u2019t care about my feelings\u201d. This confrontation happened on a Saturday, he was kicked out and was staying at a friends house. That following Monday he popped up at my house before work in tears and admitted to me he had cheated two months prior without a condom when he got too drunk downtown with his work buddies. This lead to an emotional roller coaster with the resulting STD testing and helping him find an apartment and car, but my mom expedited the process by loaning him the money. I later came to find out she jumped on the chance to get him out because she knew they had been fucking and saw this as a golden opportunity to rid him from our lives without having to own up to what she did. They told me they had planned on burying this and never telling me. \n\nMind you. my mom has been comforting me the whole time. She had my sleeping in her bed that she broke fucking my bf, took me out shopping and dining to keep my mind off the situation. She also was a mediator between my bf and I if he needed anything from the house or needed to contact me. About a week later, I\u2019m on my way home from work and my mom tells me that my bf is at the house and asks if I\u2019ll be okay seeing him when I get there, which I agree to hesitantly. Then the conversation ends, but being her middle-aged self she puts down the phone without fully hanging up (and for some reason I decide to stay on the line and mute myself). The conversation that follows is basically this: \n\nMom: \u201cAre you going to tell her?\u201d\nBF: \u201cNo, and she\u2019s not going to find out unless you say something\u201d\nMom: \u201cYou don\u2019t think [my bff female cousin] is going to say anything?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the heavily redacted version of the conversation before she finally hung up. That was the scariest drive home of my life, but I came home and held a light convo basically praying they would bring up the subject. After about thirty minutes of unrelated small talk. I finally ask the two if there\u2019s anything they want to tell me which they both deny any knowledge of what I\u2019m talking about. I mentioned the phone call, and even threw out a few hypothetical situations with tears (including flat out asking \u201cDid you fuck my mom?\u201d) which they denied. \n\nThe next morning my mom facetimes me and breaks the news in tears. I take it surprisingly well, call my cousin who is relieved because she struggled to hold in the secret and we spoke about what my bf has told her the night before. I go to work, have a regular day, still didn\u2019t shed a single tear. Finally, the following day the situation finally hits me, and I\u2019ve been treating both my mom and bf terribly since (which I feel slightly guilty about, and I\u2019ve been having random crying spells and panic attacks). Btw, the female cousin lives out of state, but we visited her recently for my mother\u2019s birthday in early September. Apparently, by that time the two had already fucked eight times. The ninth was in the hotel bathroom of our double bed room while I lay sleeping on the other side of a door. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m disgusted with their actions. My mom got secretly tested (apparently he didn\u2019t tell her he fucked another female either, we\u2019re all negative btw) and looked me in my eyes and held me when she found out I was cheated on. Additionally, after she allowed me to read through their sexts, I found out they had sex for the tenth time only a week ago (after she found out he has already cheated on \u201cus\u201d). Idk, I honestly feel like the two of them are monsters and I\u2019m disgusted by their actions. I will be going to individual counseling, but my ex-boyfriend is asking if we can go together because of my history of depression he wants to make sure I\u2019m okay. How should I handle this situation? I\u2019m not exactly in a good financial, physical, or mental place to just run away from my life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2097853, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (22F) boyfriend (25F) of 5 years had sex with my mom (57F) was 10 times", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570700975, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dfes9m/my_22f_boyfriend_25f_of_5_years_had_sex_with_my/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ididyourjessica", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_37a67rc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570610819, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dfe9vn/i29m_told_my_gf25f_how_often_i_masturbate_and_she/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dfe9vn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 201, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dfe9vn/i29m_told_my_gf25f_how_often_i_masturbate_and_she/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570610820, "score": 255, "selftext": " The main reason I masturbate is because my gf of 3 years does not match my sex drive. Before I was exclusively seeing her, I would have multiple partners and it would be as if I was going through multiple honeymoon phases. It was pretty ideal. When we sealed the deal we had our own honeymoon phase and it was sufficient at the time. Two years later and it has slowed to a crawl. Sex once or twice a week if I'm lucky. I would bring it up to her and she would say something along the lines of being tired. Understandable. I would just handle myself and go on about my day. Well she just learned how much I actually fap (normally two times a day and sometimes before sex after sex) and now she feels as though she isn't enough. She can be pretty vanilla at times and now thinks that by me handling myself, I'm cheating on her because she believes I'm thinking of other women. A huge fight ensues and makes a bad situation worse. I tried to explain everything but it just led to me being a \"perverted little boy who just learned how to use his thing\". So I decided to try to stop masturbating cold turkey. Well now I have no way to cope with the lack of sex. I am a fairly active person. I work, go to the gym, hang out with the dogs, and I try my hardest not to sit around. As of late I don't even want to go home. As my need for release rises, so does my frustration. With her wounds still being rather fresh, sex is none existent. My eyes wander. I am not a cheater but my God am I considering it. I'm considering this whole relationship. I know relationships are work and require a bit of scarfice but, where does one draw the line between compromise and losing one's self?

I have had the best grades of my school for years, I go to all the nerdy stuff like debating competitions etc. That being said I don't really have many friends and so due to academics my social life was always extremely limited.

I'm F, 24, from Germany. I went to nursery school 8 years ago, moved away about 5 years ago but still keep contact to some friends from that time.\nOne of those is \"Ashley\".\n\nAshley, F, 23, came out as gay when we were in nursery school, she told me she was in love with me, I didn't feel that way for her since I'm hetero and we had a hard time. We were able to stay friends in the end and stayed in contact, not regularly, but enough that I consider her a friend.\n\nFast forward to last year, I hadn't heard from Ashley in a while, I only knew she'd recently gotten engaged to a seemingly great women.\nI posted something about my life on Twitter and Ashley responded with \"oh, that changes when you have someone to care about :)\". When I asked her to specify, she told me she was pregnant. Confused, I texted her and she told me that she had engaged in a threesome with her fiance and a male friend and gotten pregnant as the result. I was shocked, but wanted to be a good friend and listened to her. I promised her my support and she told me how hard it would be   to tell her parents everything, they'd  just gotten used to the idea that her daughter was a lesbian. I remember her mom bring pretty mean and me having to stand up for her since she couldn't do that herself back then. I told her I'd be there again. \nI kept on seeing pictures of her belly on Twitter (never with her face in it) and one day, she posted that she'd given birth. I congratulated and she told me all about how hard everything was. A few months after, our old classmates wanted a reunion party. She told everyone in the group chat that she had a kid at home and wouldn't be able to make it.\nAfter that, I'd only seen pictures of her new dog on her feed. I saw she had moved, only 3 weeks after having her child. I had a suspicion that something was fishy, but never asked.\nUntil yesterday. She texted me to see how I was doing, so naturally I asked how her son was. \n\nThen she started telling me how she was never pregnant. Everything was part of a test she'd done for a friend who studies psychology, they wanted to find out how easy it is to make people believe in your lies. She apologized and told me how you could test if someone's mentally ill if you see how easy they are to believe in unrealistic stories. She'd also gotten money for it.\nThe pictures of her belly weren't hers, the child she showed me was that of her friend.\nI got pretty mad and told her how I'm not mentally ill for believing my friend and being there for them. How I don't know if I can believe that story now.

He is a gamer, and I was not before we got together. I dabble in some PC games every now and again, but not many.

It's almost an exact replica of our house, and it made me really happy that he took time to do that. Then I realized it's just me that lives there.

He and I were laughing at something and the next moment he is pressing his hand(just on) on my breasts.I was small. It wasn't a pat, it was a push to feel stuff. I jumped up horrified and shocked and terrified, I went to \"my\" room (just a shared room) and lay in the darkness. My mom comes back from her work and wonders why I am in bed so early and asks my dad about this. I hear her voice , but not his reply, she comes over next to check on me. For the life of me I don't know what I said, I must have lied.  \n\nEvery interaction since then with my dad, I try to be physically as far away as possible. In times where it is unavoidable, he rubs my thighs and I can feel anger and shame and helplessness. I didn't pay it much attention, there were other things to mind throughout my teenage (i was at college away from home). I didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nBut now, I'm in a better place. For the past few years, I've debated back and forth on when to ask my dad about that day. They pay for my education, I cannot afford it by myself. I need their money so I am keeping shut for now..But very soon I will graduate and I will ask them then, because it's eating me away, I wonder why it had to happen and I question my memory's authenticity, because he never touched  again anywhere that would be considered sexual. The rubs on thighs? Yes that grates my stomach, but only because of my hatred(?).\n\nThe first thing that makes me want to bury this and just suffer is : for the benefit of my family. \n\nMy mom has been an angel until I was a teenager, then she started some very traumatizing verbal abuse on me for my physical appearances. I still remember the words. My mom has always been the one I'm closer with, we patched up after the teenage verbal abuse, never acknowledging how it damaged me. I got even closer and then,  after a breakup that my parents knew about, I let go of myself. That relationship was on the brink of wedding bells so it shook me and made me question what I wanted in life. It was at this point when I was noticeably \"fat\" (75kilos on a 169cm frame) that my parents visited the city I was in and they decided to poke and ridicule me. My mom spitting out her thoughts mingled with what my dad said about my body made me cry every single one of those days of that visit. This is where my mom really lost me.\n\nA year after that incident, I'm physically further away from them than I have ever been. I keep in touch with mom. One day after loads of talks with myself, I decided that my parents could be nicer to me , if they were nicer to each other. Their marriage was never a happy ordeal. They had tough and unloving upbringing. They were tossed in together by their elders. I naively tried to help them be courteous for starters, while being 3 timezones away.  My mom made it clear that she had accepted this way of her life when I asked if she wanted to make an attempt. It broke me to see them give up on meaningful relationships and fill their time with hate and junk. I hate that after all the emotional hell my mom went through because of my dad, she does not want to move forward in anyway.  But I sympathize with her and pity her. My pity extends to my dad too, but not too much, he has been far too dominant and I cannot find it in my heart to forgive him or forget everyone of those moments. I want to help my mom, but she sides with my father most of the time and clobbers me.  \n\nI don't want to sit my mom and dad down and ask my dad - why he touched me? because, I don't want my mom to live alone with my dad after knowing how horrible he has been. I don't want to tell this to my brother, because he has a daughter and her grandpa is wonderful to her. \n\nAnother reason why I don't want to break this out is : My dad has never again touched me in the way he did when I was 13. Does this count as child abuse? or even sexual? Could it have been a mistake?! But he never apologized if it was!\n\nAm I delusional? Am I being a weak victim? I don't want to break my family apart. I don't want to save my mom or let her fall after this. I'm ofcourse thinking that my mom is going to be disgusted at my dad when I explain what happened, but if she is disgusted at me... then it makes it easier to cut off ties with them. But I think, she will believe me, I don't want to expose her to a new area of my dad's toxicity and leave her to deal with it. I truly pity and sympathize with her. She deserves better, but because of what she did to me I cannot, be the one to help her. Please advice me, or suggest what I could do.   \n\nAs I see it, I make my mom sit with me and dad and listen in on. and then tell my brother (he lives in another city), and respectfully cut my ties with them, disregarding the hell I've probably thrown my family into. \n\nI tried to make this as short as possible.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2096192, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should I (25F) , ask my dad (61M) why he touched me and make my family aware of this incident?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570653712, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/df5wpv/should_i_25f_ask_my_dad_61m_why_he_touched_me_and/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "RamsThrowaway19", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3z0oiw53", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570564979, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/df5coq/fianc\u00e9_30f_is_sick_and_proposed_a_one_sided_open/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df5coq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 94, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/df5coq/fianc\u00e9_30f_is_sick_and_proposed_a_one_sided_open/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570564980, "score": 259, "selftext": "My partner is battling a long term chronic illness, and as part of her treatment they have her on drugs that have killed her sex drive and ability to be physical is almost any way.

In the next hour or so that transpired, I had a few texts with my boss to confirm some info about a meeting presentation today. The text thread with my boss was professional, and then SOMEWHAT personal. Here's verbatim of what we were saying at the end.\n\n**ME:** just emailed a new version, think this one will suffice. let me know!\n\n**BOSS:** perfect. thx! seriously, huge help. sorry to bother you off-hours\n\n**ME:** oh any time, not a problem. i did it while watching the game on my couch with beer in hand.\n\n**BOSS:** multi-tasking! boooo 9ers!!!\n\n**ME:** haha! don't hate.\n\n**BOSS:** i kid, i kid. i have no beef with them. big win, you'd better celebrate!\n\n**ME:** oh i will! :)\n\n[35 minutes later...]\n\n**ME:** [picture of my cleavage]\n\nSo, yeah...boss and I had a work-then-personal/informal text thread. I was also texting with my old FWB. When I finally got up and took a good pic for my FWB, I accidentally sent it to my boss. I feel like the context makes it sound like I was drunk and was responding to his encouragement that I \"celebrate\" or something. UGH. FML.\n\nI basically had a panic attack about 20 minutes later last night when I realized what I did. My boss did NOT text me back. I gathered myself and then sent this text.\n\n**\"i'm SO sorry. as you prob know, that picture that i sent was absolutely NOT meant for you. i was simultaneously texting with somebody else. i am super embarrassed and i hope we can both delete this and move on.\"**\n\nHe did not text back last night (it was late). He did not text this morning. I'm at the office but he's not in the office today.\n\n**Is there anything else I should be doing about this? If he does acknowledge or want to talk about it, what should I do/say? What if he reports this to HR? Then what? Please help.**\n\nTL;DR: Sent a cleavage pic to my boss, the context makes me look bad, when I realized what I did I let him know, but I'm scared to death I'm going to be in trouble / lose my job.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2095609, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[25/f] I accidentally sent a seductive/sexy cleavage pic to my boss [38/m] last night.

He was really nice.... at first, but then I started to notice that, well, he\u2019s fucking crazy. It started with him randomly staring at my phone. I\u2019d get stoned and I noticed more when I was high cause I could feel him looking over my shoulder and his eyes just peer at my screen. It was uncomfortable and I\u2019d get annoyed and let him know. He wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge I said \u201cenjoy staring at my screen?\u201d Then he started texting me every waking second, god, buzz! Buzz! Buzz! It made me nervous, I didn\u2019t even feel those feels when I looked at him. He became just a burden. One day, it was fucking horrible, my grandpa is very sick, he refused to come help me move big rocks to help out my grandpa. We moved them from in front of backhoe so my grandpa could try and rebuild the backhoe. He just sat there and freaking watched me. He wouldn\u2019t ever talk to me, he\u2019d pout and stare off into space like something was wrong with him! Something really is! Then started the talk, I mean he\u2019d drop it here and there but then it got worse, \u201cmy dad must hate me.\u201d His dad died in either 2013 or 2016, he\u2019d constantly use that and the fact no one loves him as reasons to die. I started catching on to him lying about killing himself. He only would stop making a big fuss when someone in our friend group or myself would finally go and find him. Which was always the same place. I hated the way he touched me, he was never gentle and really rough and careless.  So I ended it. I broke up with him. He cried the whole time saying I\u2019m the one for him. I really didn\u2019t want to be mean but I said \u201cbut I don\u2019t want you, please stop begging.\u201d And he went silent. I didn\u2019t talk to him the next day, I had a good day that day. Then he started being short in texts, saying that everything is shit and he\u2019s the only one helping ranch (our friend) who\u2019s throwing up because all of him and his friends are drunk as hell. The next morning he tells me he had a seizure. I\u2019ve seen him have one it\u2019s terrifying. I don\u2019t know what to do, I say I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s horrible. He goes \u201cyea. It is.\u201d Then last but not least, he says he\u2019s in the woods with a noose around his neck and I call him and he\u2019s fake choking, he\u2019s not loosing air he can speak fine. I know what that sound is I\u2019ve made that sound. I was so fed up, tears were in my eyes and my mom, she grabbed her phone and dialed the police number for his county he lives in. They knew who he was automatically, the whole time I stayed on the phone with him and he kept lying about where he was. I knew he was on the south side. He lied and I could tell by the sirens. He called a friend to help get the noose off but the police were on the phone with my mom when they found him. There was no noose. His friend, who he lives with (and his friends mom) are upset I called the cops. I know they are.  Why did he do this? Why won\u2019t he stop? It\u2019s really scary to see things like this.

That same day I made the original thread I stuck true to my word and talked to him about this during dinner. I made his favorite in order to ease the blow but I essentially came at him with the most blunt but nice way I could put it (thanks to the help of you lovely people). I basically told him that I'm happy that his life has improved drastically since this change but I really do miss who I originally fell in love with and I wasn't sure I could keep this charade up. There was a lot of crying from myself only and he kept his cool and composure as Soubi would. In all honesty it made me more upset. Our fights, although rare, would sometimes turn into a shouting match because he'd usually get really upset and fire back at me. Now he's calm, gentle, understanding, and it progressively upset me more and more. Yet he continued comforting me which only made it worse. It's weird how you when you love someone you even miss the bad parts about them when they go away.\n\nAfter a while I calmed down. The two biggest takeaways from the conversation were that even if he found someone who was fictionkin to Ritsuka he wouldn't leave me for them because that was another life and, in this life, he has me now. This is important later. The second was that he himself felt that all his life he was putting on a mask and only behaving as people expected him to; including me. He claims he never really felt 100% truly comfortable in his own skin and this awakening was like a switch that needed to be turned on and now he feels like himself for the first time in his entire life. He then told me he understands that I signed up to date the man I fell in love with not Soubi and he wouldn't blame me for leaving. \n\nI couldn't blame him either. The truth is I know what that feels like. I was raised a very sheltered life and didn't really have a personality because of it. I only started coming out of my shell during my college years when I moved out of state to live on my own. I still find the fact it took a cartoon for this to finally make him realize that really concerning and I still didn't like that it was such a drastic change and I worry about his mental health. He assures me he is fine. I slept on it and I felt moderately better the next day. I decided at that point I was going to just try and change my perspective and adjust to this life. I love the guy. I want to at least try and make it work.\n\nOver the next few days my distain for this Soubi thing died down. I was starting to feel attracted to him again. I started really liking how sweet and soothing he'd become. I'd get twinges of missing the old him here and there but as days went on it definitely became easier to move on from them now and focus on my new life now.\n\nThen... Sunday night happened.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon he came home work and told me that he'd like me to meet some of his new friends that he's made over the last several months. He told me that a lot of them are just like him. They are kin to some type of animal, spirit, fictional character or they're transgender and it's like a support group in a way. It was a lot to throw at me but I decided, hey, I might as well see these other people like him so I can understand their culture better. He was happy and immediately got on his phone to message the discord group they have. The plan was to have people over tomorrow night for dinner and he wanted to cook.\n\nSunday rolls around and he told me that only one of them can make it. No big deal. I played a little bit of Spyro as he cooked. His guest finally showed up sometime during the evening and I went to answer the door. The person I see before me is this really young... how can I put this. They were somewhat of an androgynous mess. I couldn't tell if they were a boy or a girl. They were this weird in-between. I later found out they were a female to male transgender man so, for the sake of making this easier, I'll be referring to them as male. He makes me eye contact with me when I open the door. He's glancing to the side clearly way too shy to even look in my general direction. I ask him his name and mumbles it. I didn't ask again and just invited him in. My boyfriend greets him with... a pat on the head. Weird. This guy just stands idlely leaning on the banister in the hallway still looking like he hates being here. Also weird. I invited him to come sit on the couch with me and play Spyro while my boyfriend finishes cooking. He sat down and said nothing just watching the screen as I played. I offered him the controller but he brushed it off. He just watched and nothing more. He didn't even pull out a cellphone or anything like most kids his age would do. I mean, hell, I'm in my mid 20s and I'm addicted to my phone.\n\nMy boyfriend finished cooking and we all sat down to eat. His guest would not talk to me at all, but every time he spoke to him he would illicit some type of response from his guest. What bothered me was how flirtatious it all seemed. My boyfriend would make remarks like, \"You'd be even cuter if you smiled more,\" or how he would love to him more lively like he is when they hang out. His guest didn't really say anything but his face would often say it all. It was a mixed bag of embarrassment but liking it at the same time. I was confused and I felt really uncomfortable. He tried to encourage his guest to talk to me and tell me about himself but he wouldn't say anything other than what high school they were going to. Yes, high school. First red flag.\n\nAfter dinner we decided to sit on the couch and watch a movie together. I sat next to boyfriend, obviously, but his guest sat next to him on the other side and I don't mean just casually sitting next to him. I mean he was as close as I was with their hips touching. Second red flag. As I was fidgeting with the menus my boyfriend was trying to comfort his guest. He was talking to him about how he shouldn't be afraid of me, that he can relax in our home, and was petting his head and stroking his hair. Third red flag. I was really not liking this at all and getting increasingly more upset. I went to grab my phone to distract myself and that's when I noticed that my boyfriend was holding his guest's hand and was gliding his thumb on the back of this dude's hand!\n\nI flipped. And when I say I flipped I mean I legitimately got up and yelled, \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!\" My boyfriend sighed. He said he was hoping me andhis guest could have hit it off better but it was clear his guest wasn't \"ready.\" What kind of fucking response is that?! I was fuming. I said I didn't care about that and wanted to know why he was flirting with an underage kid much less with anyone other than me! His guest bolted out the door by this point. My boyfriend stood up, faced me, but kept his eyes looking at the floor apologizing, saying he had this whole idea planned out and asked me to calm down so he could explain it. I put on a mask and pretended I calmed down but I was still fucking furious.\n\nApparently this guest of his, this 17 year old female to male transgender kid, was someone from his friendship circle that is fictionkin to Ritsuka; Soubi's 12 year old lover from the anime. There was never any intention of seeing anyone else; at least not yet. His plan was to get me to hit it off with this fucking kid, have a few more get togethers done, and he would then propose the idea of starting a polyamorous relationship with him, me and my boyfriend once I grew closer to the kid so I'd be more open to it. I felt fucking sick to my stomach. All I could see was red. I was screaming and yelling at my boyfriend for lying to me about his true intentions, that even if I were okay with poly the kid is underage, and he's sick for grooming a child like that.\n\nIn his defense he did apologize for trying to trick me. However he started making excuses saying he wasn't grooming the kid, he was expressing the same love he always gave Ritsuka, the same love he gave Semei (Soubi's original lover in the anime) that Semei told him to give Ritsuka should anything happen to him, and he would never take advantage of him and would wait until he is ready, that he was turning 18 soon anyway, etc. I told him that's not okay. He's late 20s and shouldn't be trying to date fucking high schoolers! He had the audacity to say that age is just a number and I damn near put my hand through a fucking wall... I'm sorry. I'm getting way too angry remembering all this. But I don't want to rewrite it. I had take a few deep breaths to finally get even close to speaking levels again. I then asked him what happened to the whole, \"You'd never leave me for a Ritsuka fictionkin\" thing. He assured me again he still wouldn't ultimately leave me for someone else but reminded me about the other day when he told me that he still misses Ritsuka and he thought maybe we could all be together. \n\nHe wanted the best of both worlds. I feel betrayed and manipulated. The more and more I replay what happened the more I begin to suspect the people who claimed he was abusing me were right. I went upstairs, packed up a duffle bag with some essentials, and left the house, got in my car, and made the 18 hour trip to my parent's house. He never once tried to stop me. I think he understands the gravity of what he did. The only thing I got from him was a text message saying he was sorry. When I got to my parent's house I gave them the cliff notes version; Something happened, I haven't slept since Saturday night, and I need crash. It's 7:30 am and I'm now mustering up the courage to get out of bed tell my folks everything that happened.\n\nI've calmed down after sleeping but I still don't know what I'm going to do. In all honesty I may not even provide another update. Doing this was more of a cathartic thing than it was seeking for advice and because I was asked to make an update.\n\nThank you for all of those who gave me such helpful advice. I think I'm going to just move on, break up with him, and find someone who isn't fucking deranged. I love you all. I wish you all good health and happiness in your futures.\n\nSigning off.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2095255, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE: My [24M] boyfriend [27M] has turned into an anime character and I'm not sure what to do anymore.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570631993, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/df0vgt/update_my_24m_boyfriend_27m_has_turned_into_an/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRA90210", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4r5qj76w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570544141, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/df0jxf/my_24m_girlfriend_22f_wants_to_remain_friends/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df0jxf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 277, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/df0jxf/my_24m_girlfriend_22f_wants_to_remain_friends/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570544143, "score": 263, "selftext": "Before I (24M) got with my girlfriend (22F), she had sex once with this guy she now calls her friend.

Untill recently, i became a little distant since i had just graduated and i was struggling to find a job which affected our relationship.last week we went together like a normal couple, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, we even made out in a parking lot LOL. we went to grab lunch and then she told me jokingly that if i give her my meal we can breakup. i thought it was a joke so i went along with, then she started getting into details and started crying.when i asked her why she told me it's loved me too much and she had so many problems that she'd rather break up with me on good terms than for her to do something stupid and lose me for good. i didnt know what to say so i agreed , telling her that since she told me this she already made up her mind. we held hands and she started bawling her eyes out. we kissed for the last time and we went our separate ways. A week after a common friend of ours told me that she met a guy while we were distant and she slept with him within a week, all of this while we were still together, and then i found out that they traveled together last weekend. I have so many questions : How could she do this to me given that i always treated her right and never so much talked to another girl? my friend told me that the guy she met approached her while i was getting real distant and she went for it.i also know that she has a promiscuous female friend who's been influencing her all along to become like her.\n\nI'm asking you what can i do to forget this ever happened because i really havent eaten or slept properly for almost a week? and is there any way i can get back at her so i give her a taste o f her own medecine, make her feel the agony i'm feeling right now.\n\nThank you in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2095201, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gf(23f) of two years broke up with me(24M) all of a sudden and i just found out she cheated on me while we were dating.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570630441, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/df0j8l/gf23f_of_two_years_broke_up_with_me24m_all_of_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dwotmf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qydg4xv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570541198, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dezxt3/my_bf_masturbates_to_my_family/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dezxt3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 230, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dezxt3/my_bf_masturbates_to_my_family/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570541199, "score": 395, "selftext": "Let\u2019s start from the beginning. My bf and I have been dating for almost 6 years now. A year or so into our relationship, he let me use his laptop to look up something and when I opened up his laptop there was pictures of my sisters, cousins and my close friends, cropped so that it\u2019s just their faces and put it on porn bodies. (He didn\u2019t know he left it up)There was about 20 or more of these edited pictures. I felt sick to my stomach. I confronted him and he said he took adderral and his mind gets fucked up whenever he does. Which I did notice whenever he took an adderral he was extra horny and always wanting to have sex like 5 times every single time. Basically he was very sorry and said it won\u2019t happen again and it just fucked him up in a way that\u2019s very inappropriate. He was embarrassed and didn\u2019t wanna talk about it anymore and promised me he wouldn\u2019t take adderral anymore. He\u2019s not an adderral taker either, he\u2019ll take it once in a while. Fast forward to last week, almost 6 years into our relationship. (We now share a laptop with different logins.) he was still logged in and forgot to close his last browser. To my surprise? Basically same thing, now he has a secret email and it\u2019s just filled with about 70 pictures of my sisters, cousins and my close friends edited into porn bodies. I don\u2019t mind porn at all. But cropping out my family and friends faces into these porn bodies just takes it to whole another level. And he started saving these earlier in the year. I looked at the date and some of them he did take adderral (like I said he only takes them once in a while that\u2019s why I know when he took it and everytime it would be a big fight bc we both know how it makes him\u2014fucking creepy) but some of those dates when he made the pictures he did not take an adderral. He\u2019s taking pictures of my sisters and friends off of social media and just saving them. Pictures of them in bikinis, tight dresses and he will put a full picture of them next to the edited picture of their face in a porn body. I saw the pictures of my family and I don\u2019t even know where he found some of them they were old so he must\u2019ve really taken the time to creep into each and one of their social media\u2019s to find these pictures. And the last thing he saved was from 2 days ago were pictures of my cousin in her tight dress. And I know for a fact that he did not take an adderral. So I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s just using the adderral now just an excuse. No doubt adderral plays a big part of this but last time he saved a pic like I said he did not take an adderral. Our sex life is great, no complaints there, but now it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even want to have sex bc I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking about. He doesnt know that I now know about his secret email and it is eating me up inside. I feel so numb sometimes, I don\u2019t know what to do. He\u2019s an amazing boyfriend other than that, I have no complaints but that. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m dating a creep. And it makes it so awkward when we\u2019re around my family that he wacks off to. Please give me advice. I\u2019m heartbroken. Do I throw away the 6 years and move on or try to work it out. But that\u2019s the thing, if he\u2019s been doing behind my back, it\u2019ll always be in the back of my mind and will always bother me.

To start I\u2019m a recently realized bisexual living in a more southern state. I was raised with a certain set of views and ideas that really impacted my life. To make a long story short after watching my openly lesbian sister be ostracized by my other family members and being the target of bullying and isolation for a rumor that I\u2019m my mind at the time held no truth (that I was a lesbian as well). You can imagine I was a bit torn to finally realize I really did like girls. Years or guilt, self punishment, and shame left me pretty hopeless until about a little over a year ago I decided \u201cfuck it\u201d I\u2019m just gonna let myself be me and let myself do what felt right! \n\nFast forward to the more recently. I\u2019m just as unlucky with girls as I am with guys and twice as shy so after a few first dates and fewer second dates I start talking to this really cool down to earth girl on a dating app. We exchange numbers and before I know it we\u2019ve planned a time to hang out. Now, I\u2019m not one for planning ahead when I get excited about something so later I found out she\u2019s in a town about 2 hours away (not a huge deal I\u2019m used to driving those kinds of distances) before I leave I find out she\u2019s at a hotel and is only here for work... that\u2019s right she doesn\u2019t even live here. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Oh she\u2019s just here for a townie hook up. Well maybe you\u2019re right. I decide hey why not take a chance maybe we\u2019ll just talk and have fun and be friends. So we go out and come back. It\u2019s getting late and I decided to stay the night and leave the next day. I\u2019m not stupid. Showing up I knew it was a possibility we\u2019d end up sleeping together but the choice was mine. She didn\u2019t make a single move but responded happily to the moves I made. \n\nThis was my first time even being this close with a girl and I didn\u2019t intend to take it that far but I never expected to feel the way I did. When we scooted in closer, while watching tv, just the simplest touch of our legs warmed up my entire body. I was getting goosebumps and chills of excitement the closer we got. I never imagined it\u2019d be something so powerful. After a mostly sleepless night, I basked in the soft, simple, yet overwhelming intimacy of skin against skin. I was no longer aware of myself as a body. My mind was only experiencing sensations and emotions.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking/meeting up for a few weeks and we are both aware what we have has an expiration date but rather than having a lengthy conversation about the future and our standing we settled for an unspoken truce to love each other without fears or restraints for the time given to us. \n\nNow here\u2019s where we are. I knew the rules going in I knew the facts but here\u2019s what you don\u2019t know about me... I decided to never love with fear or hesitation. I walk right in and let the dice fall where they may. I promised myself to go forward with my heart wide open no matter how many times it gets broken or rejected because guess what? That\u2019s just a part of life. Heartbreak in its own way is beautiful. Painful and gut wrenching but beautiful. It shows you the capacity of your heart to truly love someone. For every bitter feeling, a beautiful memory mourned but made all the same. So, while I\u2019m dreading the parting, I\u2019m looking forward to creating some lasting memories. I guess I\u2019ve always been a fan of romance even though I hardly believe it\u2019ll ever really work out for me in the long run. I\u2019m just focusing on the here and now. \n\nShe only has 2 weeks left here before she gets sent overseas for a couple of months. \nSo, I wanted to create a memory that encompasses many different things normally couples share during their time together but all in one. Here\u2019s my idea: I want to gather a few items or tokens to represent most major holidays and present them one after another. I want to spend a year with her in one day. \nI need help putting into words what each item represents for us it\u2019ll be tragic but sweet I hope and above all I hope to give her a unique memory of me to revisit as life goes on. So for example a single rose for Valentine\u2019s Day to represent all the flowers I won\u2019t get to give her. A candle for all the birthday wishes I wouldn\u2019t get to hear. I can\u2019t quite think of a great 4th of July token but I was gonna play fireworks in the background and say it was for all the fireworks she made me feel and the ones we won\u2019t be watching. Thanksgiving was a tough one but I want to give her something for how grateful I am that I met her and took this chance and that the item represents all the thanks I couldn\u2019t give her. I want to do mistletoe for Christmas not sure what to say. Then a New Years hat to represent all the beginnings and ends from here on out and how I resolve to always remember these moments. Then I\u2019ll count down from 10 and end with a kiss.\n\nI\u2019d love ideas and if someone feels passionate and inspired enough to put into more eloquent words what I\u2019d like to express with each item I\u2019d be forever grateful!! Thank you to those who stuck through this long post\n\nTLDR - took a chance with a girl who has a limited time near me. Our time ends soon and I want to make one last big memory by gathering up items to represent the major holidays/events couples usually get spend together and give them to her with a brief explanation of what they mean to us. In other words I want to spend a year in a day with her. Ideas on symbolic items and what it means would be appreciated. Thanks!

They never wanted me to wed their son (30m). However, we got married and they were at least pleasant in my company so I was fine with that. They got super involved with me when I was pregnant but as soon as I gave birth I was again just someone they said hi and bye to whenever they'd come to visit. \n\nHowever, shiz hit the fan when they came over for my kids 2nd birthday. My family and my husband's family was invited plus some co-workers. The party was set at 3. They came at 12 and played with the baby all the way until 3 when the baby got tired so I took her down for a nap. My family had not arrived yet as my mom was working and she was going to be late, my sister was sick with the flu, and my brother was dealing with a new born baby. The coworkers who were supposed to come also said they couldn't make it last minute. My family came late but they all had valid excuses and the baby was sleeping anyway. \n\n30 minutes go by and MIL is already asking when I'm going to wake up the baby. I say I'm not waking him up because then she'd just be fussy from being overtired. but she keeps asking and asking. Finally after 2 hours my FIL gets up and starts yelling a bunch of mean stuff about me and my family and then promptly left with MIL just as my family was arriving.\n\nI later told them that I wish they wouldn't have left as the baby was finishing her nap and I wanted them to celebrate with her but that I also did not appreciate what was said and that going fwd I wanted respect in my home. They. Blew. Up. Told me a bunch of more nasty things and that was it. \n\nI wanted to move on from this but I felt like I couldn't until they apologized for what was said about me and my family. I asked my husband to ask for an apology and they said no and then blew up again saying more mean stuff and that I needed to apologize to them because my family was late to the party. \n\nThey now want to see my daughter and husband at their place (3hrs away). I do not feel comfortable with this. I just don't see how they can disrespect me and then feel entitled to spend time with my daughter. My husband thinks it's fine for him to take our daughter to see them and I just stay at home but it makes me feel like no one gives a care about me. Like, it's okay to disrespect me and say mean things about me because I'm nothing and they're entitled to my daughter. \n\n\nThis whole situation makes me feel bad because I truly wanted to have a good relationship with them but I feel like the damage is irreperable and I 100% will never trust them to not talk negatively about me to my husband or daughter. As of right now I don't want them to have any contact with me or my daughter until time heals the hurt I feel over what they said. Only once I feel comfortable being around them again would I be willing to meet somewhere so they can see my daughter.  But that's just what I'm thinking. Im writing this post to help answer what I should do regarding them visiting my daughter or what my next steps to get this issue fixed should be?\n\nTldr in-laws have been disrespectful to me but still want to see grandchild.

He says he's just a transient and will be moving out soon, but he's broke and doesn't seem to have a realistic plan, so I don't see how that will happen.\n\nThe problem is I have seen him several times masturbating while looking into our backyard and pool, as my husband's teenage daughters (17 &amp; 14) are sunbathing or hanging around the pool. Yes, his own granddaughters.\n\nFrom our second floor nursery window, I can see directly into the guest house and pool area. I've even taken phone video with the intention of showing my husband, but I haven't had the courage to do it. My husband's father is his hero, so I don't know how he'll react and how that will affect our family.\n\nMy step daughters, whom I love like my own, live in booty shorts and bikini tops. That's all they wear around the house, and they always have. When I married my husband in 2015 and moved in, I immediate raised concerns about their lack of clothing around the house, but it was a battle I lost early on.\n\nTheir mother passed away when they were very little, and my husband raised them as a single father. Even though they accepted me in their lives and we've always gotten along great, they see me more as an older friend than as a motherly figure.  And to be fair, their wardrobe hasn't been a problem until now.\n\nSo yes, I have disturbing video and it's very clear what he's doing and whom he's looking at while doing it. Since I first saw him doing it about a month ago, I have done everything in my power to keep the girls physically away from him, but I have a baby boy and a part time job, so it hasn't been easy because I'm not always there.\n\nI cringe when he gets near them and starts caressing their hair or touching their bare skin. I've asked the girls to cover up \"out of respect for their grandpa\", but they look at me like I'm the crazy one.\n\nBut this is actually driving me insane because it's like clockwork now. As soon as the girls go out to the pool area, he sits by the window and starts touching himself. After a while he stands up, walks closer to the window, pulls out his penis, and gets himself off. And because I have recorded him, now I sort of feel like a dirty pervert myself.\n\nI have thought about confronting him, telling him what I've seen, and asking him to leave or I'll tell his son, but I'm afraid the confrontation could turn violent.\n\nSp what can I do? If I show my husband the video proof, I have no idea how he'll react. He's not argumentative or hot blooded, but this is difficult to watch.\n\nI have also worked very hard to become a friend and a confidant to those two beautiful girls, and I don't want them to hate me for exposing their perverted grandfather.\n\nI love the girls, I love my husband, and we have a one year old child. I fear this could destroy our happy family, and that eventually I'll be the one to blame.\n\nTL;DR -- I've caught my father in law masturbating while staring at his teenage granddaughters.

She rang me and and I answered and asked if we could meet Sunday night. Normally I'd not answer but because she had it from a withheld number and I was pissed, I said yeah alright. \n\nWhen she came around, I was all set to be guns blazing and tell her to fuck off. But when I saw her, I felt all emotional and broke down - she did too. We hugged really well, and she kept on saying how awful I looked and how much weight I'd lost. \n\nShe apologized and kept apologising profusely. She said she had to report me on the basis that her son looked so in distress and she couldn't not report it as a mother. But she said she in hindsight knew I wouldn't be capable of what he said I did, and she hasn't been sleeping or thinking straight of what I could be going through. Apparently once her so admitted to the police it wasn't me and it was his cousin, the police got a confession out if her nephew and he said he was molested himself do he was only doing what happened to him. I couldn't try and be all nice and understanding, and I said I couldn't give a fuck - she seemed quite stunned by this, but as she could see I was really distressed she didn't argue the point. \n\nBasically she said she wanted to know where we go from here and that she loved me so much and that she wanted to know if I could move on from it. She also had a letter from her son - basically he's been really poorly and he was so upset about what he said I'd did and asked if I'd read it. \n\nI don't know what happened at this point, but I got really angry. I said I couldn't read his letter. She got all pissed and said that he's only a kid, and he's been struggling so much - did our little relationship mean so little to me? I felt so fucking blind sided, and said that it wasn't my fault he accused me of being a Paedo. After a lot of arguing, raised voices and hurt feelings I said I'd take the letter but couldn't promise I'd want to reply - I mean his accusation is going to likely ruin my career. She said she was done at this point, but stressed how much she loved me and asked if I could ever forgive them. I said I couldn't promise. She also felt awful that I was likely losing my job the next day.  We hugged it out, kissed and left it there. \n\nOn the subject of my work, it's bittersweet. \n\nI arrived there for my meeting and briefly seeing my colleagues, they were treating me like shit.  One woman who's been like my work mum and mentor, was looking down her nose instantly. I tried to talk to her and she just walked off mid conversation. Several others were all looking at me as if I'm the worst human being ever. \n\nWhen I got into the meeting, it looked as if I was just going to be sacked and that was it. But I'm a pretty good negotiator, and I managed to beat them back to being not to blame at all. Basically, we argue a deal where I resign, but they agree to give me a great reference.

I was nervous to do this at first, but it paid off.\n\nLast night, after I finished freaking out, I knew I had to sit down with my parents and tell them what happened. I was scared, not because they had a problem with me being gay, but because who wants their parents to see them fucking? Not cool. Besides, if she could sent it to my parents, she would have zero issues sending it to anyone. I was honest with them, and they took my side. I told them I wanted to leave her, and they backed me up and sat with me as I composed a message essentially telling my now ex-girlfriend I had proof of her trying to blackmail me, and I was going to the police if she tried to send that video. I had my parents call her from their phones, telling her not to contact them. Best parents ever, seriously. But she started blowing up my phone, begging me to take her back. She was apologizing and saying she would never send videos of me to anyone. Yeah, okay. I blocked her immediately. She's insane and I deserve better than that shit.\n\nDespite all the action I took to protect myself, I didn't feel like what I did was enough. I was past scared and I was just pissed off that she tried to use this against me. I did some research and from everyones comments, its obviously super illegal so I called the 24 hour non emergency line for my city, and after explaining the story, an officer came out to my house to take down my info and hear what happened. I showed him a few of the texts and he had officers GO TO HER FUCKING HOUSE. She called me from some weird ass text free number, and continued to blow up my phone apologizing for everything and begging me not to press charges. I decided not to but I just ghosted her. Some people may find that stupid, but she learned her lesson. We are over for good. She's blocked on everything and she's out of my life and I feel better than I have in 2 years (The length of our relationship).\n\nMoral of the story is never ever EVER allow someone to force you into something or blackmail you. Fuck that. If you find yourself in this situation, you have to get ahead of it. CALL THE POLICE! I almost waited and you guys told me not to so thank you so much for everything.

We were there for about 2 hours and got really drunk. Before I went to the bar I took 2 shots of tequila just to kind of get in the mood cause I really didn't want to go out. After we left the bar we went to my best friend's house and bought even more beer and started to smoke some weed. Everything was going well up until her wife started being all touchy and kept tried to whisper things into my ear in front of my best friend. It was awkward as fuck and I kept trying to push her cause I started to get really pissed off by how she was acting. I had to tell my best friend 'yo, you should really send her to bed already' which he did but she didn't care and kept doing stupid things. It was about 4 am and was getting really sleepy, not to mention I was extremely drunk at this point and could barely walk, talk, or organize my thoughts.\n\nMy girlfriend had previously called me to see how I was holding up and she knew I was drunk as hell because as I said, I could't even talk. I don't remember a lot of things so I don't even recall going downstairs to sleep on the couch. After I went to sleep the worst happens... for some reason I thought my gf was there with me whispering thins in my ears. We say 'amor' to each other so I remember I was literally saying 'Amor, what are you doing here?' 'Amor, when did you get here?' My friends wife started kissing me and touching me. I had no idea what the fuck was happening, I thought it was just a dream... I didn't even open my eyes cause I was so sleepy so my drunken ass thought I was with my gf at that time. Things got bad... she started giving me oral sex, grinding up on me but like I said, I was too drunk to process what was going on and I'm sure I wasn't even erect. I don't find her attractive at all, don't have any feelings for her, never even thought about this kind of stuff. Up until she started going really hard that's when I woke up and didn't know how to react, I couldn't talk, couldn't move, I really wanted to throw up, and the only thing that she said was 'you want to go to sleep' and I just said 'yes' so she left.\n\nAfter I woke up that's when it hit me, I din't know what to do, what to say, whether I should tell my best friend about what happened right at that moment so I just played it cool like nothing ever happened.\n\nThings to have in mind:\n\n\\- Previously at the bar they told me they were thinking about divorce.\n\n\\- They have a fucking child together...\n\n\\- I was similarly abused when I was little by this one guy and couldn't get over it up until I met my gf, so this is giving be really bad throwbacks and I am seriously considering killing myself. I just feel dirty and been having so many negative thoughts about life and everything.\n\n\\- Me and my gf have pretty bad anxiety and depression issues.\n\n\\- My gf has tried to kill herself before so saying something like this to her could put her health at risk.\n\nMe and my gf have been together for a little bit more than a year, we have a promise ring already. I'm 23 and she's 20 we have so many goals together. We promised we would say everything to each other and that we wouldn't have any secrets.\n\nI beg you guys to please help me with this situation, I'm stuck and I have no idea about what I need to do to fix this. My girlfriend is all that matters to me, she is the love of my life and I'm really scared of loosing her. She really is the perfect girl for me. I know this is all my fault for drinking too much but being with my best friend put me in that comfort zone of getting wasted with no worries cause I was somewhere 'safe'.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2092884, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My best friends wife took advantage of me while I was blackout drunk, how do I tell my girlfriend?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570567136, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/depdy2/my_best_friends_wife_took_advantage_of_me_while_i/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Mybigthowaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_484tkxj4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570476838, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deog18/i_22f_am_becoming_scared_of_sex_with_my_boyfriend/", "gildings": {}, "id": "deog18", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 179, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/deog18/i_22f_am_becoming_scared_of_sex_with_my_boyfriend/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570476840, "score": 214, "selftext": "Hello, thank you for reading!\n\nMy boyfriend has never liked doing foreplay and prefers to skip it. I didn't need it in the beginning because the relationship was new and shiny and I was always ready to go. After it got more dull, I talked to him about needing foreplay. He was disappointed and hurt but he did attempt it most times and we still had pretty good sex.  I usually bring up my need for foreplay once or twice a month in a very honest and open way, he listens and we will have great sex that night, but I think he assumes I just needed it that one time because it goes back to normal.\n\nThe thing is, it hurts so much. I usually have to just grit my teeth and cry because of the pain, and he gets turned off if he sees me crying and it takes even longer. I can't say no to him because he will get very upset and I end up having to comfort him. I use ice packs to help with the pain after sex, he is not at all bothered by this, ocassionally he says \"sorry\". \n\nSo the last time it happened I sort of snapped I guess and haven't been able to stomach the thought of sex with him since. It's been a couple weeks. I can't stand him touching me, I get scared and I want to cry. This \"withdrawal\" has made him extremely pushy, I can't even turn around without him being all over my ass. I'm even having vivid nightmares of being raped.\n\nA few nights ago he started forcing me to give him oral and wrestling me down while I was trying to get him to stop. He slapped me, choked me, but it was all stuff he likes to do to me during sex anyway (with my consent), it just felt rougher and left bruises. I think he thought we were joking around because he's never violent but I wasn't laughing. I had a nervous attack the next day at work and I feel like I can't live with this anymore.\n\nOutside of this massive character flaw he is not a bad person. I just can't get him to understand the impact his selfishness in bed is having on me. I think he would be open to listen, but he takes everything as an attack on him and just shuts down. Then it goes back to normal. \n\nI don't want to leave him, and I can't afford to anyway, so hopefully we can just skip that advice. I'm hoping for ideas on what I can say or do to get through to him that he's hurting me, without him getting upset and making it about him? \n\nAlso, if he does happen to apologize and want to right what he's done, how could we go about fixing the damage and rebuilding trust? \n\nTldr: Boyfriend acting aggressively towards me after no sex for a while, talking to him results in him getting upset and everything goes back to normal.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2092720, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (22F) am becoming scared of sex with my boyfriend (25m).", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570563222, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deog18/i_22f_am_becoming_scared_of_sex_with_my_boyfriend/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kudobia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qyr4ugc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570473234, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/denlcq/m24_long_distance_girlfriend_f24_of_two_years/", "gildings": {}, "id": "denlcq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 92, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/denlcq/m24_long_distance_girlfriend_f24_of_two_years/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570473235, "score": 264, "selftext": "Here it goes, this has been the worst day of my life so far. \n\nI\u2019ve been a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for two years.

I really don\u2019t even know where to begin but I\u2019ll try my best. Over the last few weeks here and there, my fianc\u00e9 has stayed out really late with his friends after work, coming home in the early hours of the morning. He is a bartender so he usually gets off around 11pm during the week, 2am-4am on weekends. I\u2019ve noticed a pattern but every time I would say something it was always turned around to be my fault. He is fully supporting us right now and uses that as an excuse that he needs guy time after work. It\u2019s to the point I have believed he is right and we make up, go about our life. Yesterday he worked a double at the bar and got cut around 6pm. He sent me a text asking if it was ok if he met up with a friend for a drink. I had absolutely no problem with that, it was going on 6:30pm. 10:30pm rolls around and he sends a text saying \u201csorry I\u2019m basically babysitting (his friend) I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d An hour goes by and he isn\u2019t home. I got a little worried and sent a text, he responded with a weird typo. It kind of freaked me out because he said an hour ago he was in the Uber on the way home- now a weird typo after he never showed up. I called him. He answers and is still downtown with his friends. It\u2019s going on 11:40 on at this point- I lost my shit on him and basically said \u201cyou are 33 years old, you have a fianc\u00e9 and baby at home what are you doing?\u201d He got mad after explaining he just wanted to get a few beers with his close friend he hadn\u2019t seen in awhile. It\u2019s 6 hours after he \u201cgot a drink\u201d and I explained that\u2019s more than enough time to get a beer, and that he had said he was on his way home over an hour ago. He kept turning it around on me that I was acting insane- that there was nothing wrong with what he was doing. We sent several long texts back and forth- his drunk friend is calling me saying it was his fault my fianc\u00e9 is still out at the bar and he wasn\u2019t doing anything behind my back and they needed guy time. They come home around 2:30 am- my fianc\u00e9 is on the couch with a blanket. I walk out and stand there- asking what the fuck is going on. He starts screaming and literally says \u201cI hate coming home, I don\u2019t even want to be around you anymore because you make such a big deal about me being out with a friend.\u201d He also says \u201cI\u2019m so tired of this bullshit boring life we live, we never do anything anymore, all you do is sit at home and do the same thing everyday\u201d \u201cwe never have sex, you don\u2019t have any friends.\u201d He also brought up that he makes all the money and he is always working to support us. I responded back saying \u201cI stay home and take care of our 3 month old, I clean this house spotless everyday, I take care of the 3 dogs we have, im trying my best\u201d He honest to god responds saying \u201care you really that incapable of taking care of a baby\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not that hard\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually doing all the hard work bringing in money to support us.\u201d I stood there speechless. I didn\u2019t even know how to respond, and the things he had said were the most hurtful things I have ever heard. I have even gone to the doctor to get prescribed medication for ppd because it is now in my head I am so terrible to be around and our arguments are my fault. All I had asked of him was to come home to his family and that going out shouldn\u2019t be more of a priority. Like I said, I don\u2019t mind if he hangs out with his friends, he needs to, we all do, but staying out and staying \u201cI\u2019m on my way home\u201d and not showing up isn\u2019t ok. I felt like the smallest person in the world. I started packing bags and after awhile he caught on and said \u201cthis isn\u2019t how it works, you aren\u2019t just going to leave with the baby.\u201d I looked at him and said \u201cyou can\u2019t even stand to come home to me, and I\u2019m the baby\u2019s mother so yes he is coming with me.\u201d He said \u201cwe have a 4 bedroom house, stay in one of the bedrooms.\u201d At this point I was beyond over it, I knew the same thing would happen like it always does, we\u2019d sleep in separate rooms, wake up the next day, eventually talk about what happened and I\u2019d take the blame. I\u2019d be the crazy woman who gets mad that her fianc\u00e9 wanted to go out with friends and I was over reacting, he supports us so he deserves to stay out. He fell asleep on the couch (he had drank a lot downtown and he\u2019s a heavy sleeper) and I left with the baby. I got a motel room off our exit. Keep in mind we live in the ghetto (up and coming area) of our city, our house is nice but the motels on the exit are absolutely terrible- a lot of prostitution, drugs, just dirty. I found what I could afford and brought towels / blankets from home so my son wouldn\u2019t touch the sheets or bed. We aren\u2019t in danger- probably in the nicest motel I could find over here. The man working the front desk could tell I had been crying and put us in a safe room right near the lobby- inside the building instead of outside.

We have built our business from the ground. We consider each other best friends, like family (he was my best man and I was his, and he is my sons godfather), although our friendship is a bit... distant like in older times where men were afraid to talk about their feelings. We can do anything for each other, but in these 10 or so years we hangout out of office maybe once or twice a month. This is mainly because we sit by each other for 10 hours a day and I live far away from the office. Mike is a very intelligent, passionate, social and charismatic person, that's why we made him CEO. I am anti-social and more of a introvert. He is very traditional though and has been with one partner since he was a teen while in the same time i've changed 4 before hitting the right girl and marrying. So whenever there was a problem in my relationships he was my go-to-guy for support, and since he has read a lot of books on relationships and psychology, he never came to me for help. Even after the loss of his mom, he took time off and we never talked about it. \n\nHim and Sarah met in school and have been together all that time. They got married 7 years ago. Their relationship was perfect, always supporting each other, loving and after all those years they were still like kids in love. I have never seen him flirt with other women, when we were on business trips they were constantly facetiming and telling each other everything about their day. You could just feel the love in their voices, they were inseparable. They were focused on their careers and were planning to have children once they were around 35, when they had enough funds and purchased their dream house.\n\nThe present:\n\nIn mid-July Mike got a call while we were glossing over our finances with our accountant, he quickly shuffled outside to talk in private and when he returned the color from his face was gone. He rushed to grab his coat and told me that Sarah was in the hospital. I grabbed my coat and we quickly sped to the hospital. When we arrived the doctor told us that apparently Sarah was at an intersection when a guy ran a red light and t-boned her car and that by the time the ambulance arrived to the hospital there was nothing the doctor could do to save her life. He went in to see her for the last time. When Mike got out of that room he lost it right there, he sat down and without any movement or emotions just stared into the wall. For hours he stayed in that position, the doctors came in to check on him and even brought down a therapist. After some convincing he agreed to leave, he came back to my house for a few nights. After that I went to his apartment with him and stayed there with him a few days just to be with him and help him cope with the loss. All that time he was emotionless, never said anything about it and barely ate. He said he will take the time off to clear his mind a bit, I was worried that he would do something stupid so I always checked up on him. At first he said he would need a few weeks or maybe a month, but after a week I was surprised to see him in his desk. And then that was basically it. He was the same guy before the accident, only he never talked about Sarah. He was cheerful, charismatic, social, basically everything that he was before losing the love of his life. I always thought that he was like a rock when it came to emotions, that he can handle anything that was thrown at him and that he overcomes any barrier in his life since he had a hard upbringing.\n\nBut today something happened. I was just leaving his apartment after dropping him off after a business trip and saw his neighbor Mrs. Smith, this sweet old woman that lives above his apartment, and she asked me how he was doing since he has been \"crying loudly once or twice a week since the accident\". This hit me like a train and I feel like shit that I couldn't see the obvious signs. How can I help my friend in this gut wrenching situation? How can I talk to him about this? I am lost and feel like a piece of shit best friend.\n\nTL;DR: Best friend of 20 years and business partner lost his SO of 15 years in a car accident, took little time to cope, came back and acted like nothing happened until I found out that he was loudly crying in his apartment for months now.

Our daughter that we love very much. The love I feel for my daughter her has really highlighted to both of us what a terrible partner and husband I have been. its like I am only now seeing and feeling love how its meant to be. \n\nMy relationship with my daughter is the first time I have taken the adult role in a relationship. In our marriage until now I have defaulted to a child role not really contributing, forcing my wife into the parental role with her dragging me though adult life.\n\nAt every major life event I have basically fallen apart inside, suppressing my emotions rather than expressing or processing them. (As I had thought that emotions are for weak people) It has resulted in me doing very selfish, self-indulgent and destructive behavior that has resulted in huge betrayals of my wife\u2019s trust, both financial betrayal with carelessly and impulsively spending lots of money on crap for myself and betrayals of infidelity, contacting people with sexual intentions and once visiting a prostitute. \n\nI had very often felt alone and unloved, and that my needs were not being met, but I can now see that I was not contributing to the relationship in any considerable way and therefore not getting the feedback and fulfillment that I so desperately need, I have been a parasite that has taken everything I can get. my wife is very generous and I have taken advantage of her fully.\n\nHaving my daughter has opened my eye to what love is meant to be. I want her to have everything, it has shown me that I have not been an active part in our relationship. I can see all the effort my wife has put into our life and that I have ignored and taken for granted. I can now see how deeply she has loved me, and that I have ruined it all.\n\nI can see that my relationship with my parents, the foundation of my idea of love is really messed up, a thing my wife has been trying to get me to see the whole time.\n\nI have previously gone to both couples and individual counselling and felt like I was beginning to understand myself. While my wife was pregnant I got in a panic that our child would impact me negatively and I would lose my identity (an idea that could not be further from how I feel now)\n\nWhat started as \u2018stocking up\u2019 on items for my hobbies before the baby was born quickly became spending lots of money on myself. More than I could possibly ever use or need.\n\nWhen my wife found out about 3 months ago she was devastated, it was the last straw. She says that she doesn\u2019t even care about me anymore and I have ruined her life.\n\nI want to make it better but as we have a small child I have limited resources to do so, \n\nI am selling 95% of my stuff, I don\u2019t need it or want it. It makes me sick to look at the excess that I have bought.\n\nI have for the time being given her financial over site and give myself a small amount for lunches etc. (as she is on maternity leave my income is the only one and I am terrible with money so this is a necessary step) and I want her to feel at least a tiny bit of security.\n\nI am doing anything in my power to make my wife and daughters life easier. Trying to be thoughtful and proactive. Planning activities and meals and stuff.\n\nI\u2019m trying to treat myself with more respect so I am not such a slob, haircuts, shaving, proper hygiene, exercise and dressing better.\n\nMy wife has said she has noticed the positive changes but it is too little too late, and that she doesn\u2019t care. She has said that at the moment our relationship is on life support and until such a time we can go to counselling in a year or so when our daughter is older and can look at making it better, or pulling the plug.\n\nalso that I need to focus on maintaining the relationship to have a happy environment for our daughter as I do not have the resources to make it better. she is very much mourning the life we could have had if I had not done all these horrible things.\n\nI\u2019m looking for some advice on what else I can do in the mean time to make my wife feel valued and rebuild some trust and security?\n\nTL:DR\n\nI have neglected and damaged my relationship for 10 years.

It wasn\u2019t constant abuse and there were great parenting moments as well but the abuse was enough to leave us with a healthy level of trauma which required therapy in order to realize that not everyone was out to eventually harm us in some way. \n\nThe abuse ranged from smacking us around to flying into rages and strangling (or I should say shaking us around by our necks). Our mother f(63) would just observe as if it was the appropriate discipline.\n\nAbout a year ago it came to light that he had had three long term relationships during his entire marriage to our mother. That\u2019s as far as we know. My father has lied about other more trivial things in the past. My mother was devastated of course and in her anger disclosed to us that when we were really young she once caught him standing over and staring at one of my sibling\u2019s (f35) best female friends when she was asleep in her bed. The friend could have been anywhere from 8-12 yrs old given the time period she was in our lives. My mother was suspicious and asked my father what he was doing and my father only recently admitted to getting off in the bathroom after staring at her. He denied doing anything further or doing it to any of our other friends or to us. Our mother accepted this but we do not. She decided to stay with him after all of this was revealed and started to minimize the severity of everything he did. \n\nThey also started denying that any physical abuse ever happened and said we were making it all up. We\u2019ve since been told that this is a common behavior of many abusive parents when they get older. \n\nWe stopped talking to them after this. They have reached out to reconcile but each time they refuse to acknowledge anything that actually happened.

It worked well because we were both at uni. (Different unis but same city) All great but we both agreed that that was all it was. So when I left the country for a summer for a job. I let her know that it was essentially over. \n\nFlash forward 6 months and it\u2019s after Christmas and I see she\u2019s out in the city (on snapchat) the same time I am, so message her to organise a coffee. It was a great time, lots of conversation and the great times continued. We would meet up almost daily in the city for coffee or breakfast, maybe lunch or dinner. It was nice. She was going to a different university now so when she left after the winter break to go back we agreed to keep communication going. Ended up we would Skype call every evening. And it worked, we would schedule a time and we would have a great laugh. So around 4 weeks of her being away I thought \u201cI have so much fun with this girl. And I\u2019m getting emotional whenever I see her and whenever I don\u2019t. My life is better when she\u2019s in it\u201d so I asked her out on one Skype chat and she said yes.\n\nWahoo right?\n\nI got up and see her at her new uni, it\u2019s great but she messaging on her phone a lot more than usual. Whenever I inquire she says it\u2019s her brother. I never second guess it. So one night I can\u2019t sleep and her phone is lighting up on the bedside table so I take a peak and it\u2019s this guy I\u2019ve never heard of sending her pictures from a vacation with guy friends. I enquire and she brushes it away but I thought if it was the other way round I wouldn\u2019t brush it away, I\u2019d be honest. I asked again and he was a guy she was seeing during the 6months we were apart, he was a from somewhere In South America and came to England for 6 months- he worked at the same place she did and they hit it off but when he needed to go back they called it off.\nWorst thing was through when she opened her phone, she was sending selfies back, nothing too NSFW but in tight clothing, and when she dresses up for a night out she sends him photos of her different outfit decisions and asks him to decide. \n\nSo now I\u2019m getting heated- I ask her to stop. Like really stop. This was my first relationship and he was her first. But even then every relationship shouldn\u2019t be like that. It made me uncomfortable and she agreed to stop messaging him and delete his contact.\n\nShe did... for maybe 2 days until I left and then it picked up again. We meet a few more time and it\u2019s happy until 2 months later her phone buzzes again whilst I\u2019m asleep next to her (this time at her home) and the dude is FaceTiming her.  So I decline the call and these two have been FaceTiming every other day for the last month. So now I\u2019m more rattled. I get angry I tell her to please stop. And at this point I\u2019m getting really bad mental pictures so she (once again) deletes his contact. Another month passes and I\u2019m at hers... she\u2019s having a shower, and at this point I believe were both happy. We spent the entire week together, just the two of us and it was blissful. Like heavenly. But something is on the back of my mind about this guy. The holidays are coming up and if he comes back to England, maybe they organised to meet up. I open up her messages(first time I\u2019ve done this- all the other times were just on the homepage notifications) and it was his birthday that day. So she sent him \u201chappy birthday gorgeous\u201d he responded very blankly \u201cthanks\u201d then she says \u201chave you had a good day hot stuff xxxx\u201d he responds kinda blankly too. \u201cYeah it\u2019s been epic\u201d so now I\u2019m thinking, she\u2019s surely the one being flirty with him... it\u2019s not the guy perusing... it\u2019s her.\n\nShe comes back from the shower and I enquire casually. She wasn\u2019t upset I looked on her phone. But she couldn\u2019t explain the flirty messages... she claimed I was overreacting. It was nonsense. But then I asked why she was messaging him like this when I thought I felt like I was enough for her... \n\nBombshell....\n\n\u201cYou left me once before so... ya know... I wanted to keep talking to him as a back-up\u201d\n\nNow for the readers... I was aware of this red flag.  I should have run. And kept running, further than Forrest Gump. But she deleted everything, I think I slept on the sofa that night.\nHer family are lovely and the next morning it seemed like nothing happened. So ya know. This girl makes me so happy. And I do t believe I have the support network to move on quickly, if we broke up this would weigh on me hard and for a long time.  So I gave it a second shot. And everything has been great for the next three years. \n\n*Flash forward to today*  there\u2019s this guy that she went to school with, they had a bit of a FWB thing in the past too. But I can\u2019t stand the bloke. She always creepy about her in front of me, he admitted at a party that he had a thing for her once at a party we were both at (early days of dating) but he always shakes it off \u201cyour a lucky guy mate\u201d \u201cyeah sure I used to have a thing for her but she\u2019s yours and I wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d \n\nThus I\u2019m always a bit uncomfortable about this guy. Just a gut feeling. \n\nBut then my GF (of 3 years now) keeps messaging him whilst I\u2019m away. I haven\u2019t seen them but she says they talk and call sometimes. And I\u2019m getting this feeling again, it feels very similar to the last guy. The back-up.\nWhenever I bring up how uncomfortable this guy makes me she claims \u201cyou\u2019re being so pathetic\u201dthey\u2019ve met up for coffee a few times over the summer and she\u2019s gone to three parties with him that I was unable to attend due to work.\n\nAt this point we\u2019re having the discussion about our dreams, weddings, wife, kids etc etc. But last time I said the ILY and she still felt like she needed a back up. It honestly is burning me to my core. Some of friends are telling me that although I love her, I can\u2019t trust her and never will so I should end it. \n\nFor the record, I\u2019ve never cheated. Never flirted with anyone intentionally. And I would never, ever create a back-up plan. \n\nWe\u2019ve got a party coming up this month where me, her and the dude will be there. (It\u2019s a big, formal party at her friends house. She invited us both) \n\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out... sorry about the length but I reviewed and everything felt necessary for perspective. I\u2019ll answer all questions. And if you want more context about thing let me know. \n\nThank you in advance", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2091509, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My girlfriends back-up plans...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570534002, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dei4cn/my_girlfriends_backup_plans/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwaway12231134", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4lbi0llw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570440751, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deh4ja/after_a_11_year_relationship_i_had_a_1_night_stand/", "gildings": {}, "id": "deh4ja", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 421, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/deh4ja/after_a_11_year_relationship_i_had_a_1_night_stand/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570440752, "score": 260, "selftext": "Last fall my (29/f) ex bf (29/m) and I broke up after 10 years.

He was unwilling to compromise on anything and he just feels that I'm being too demanding and that he never gets alone time. If I was lucky I got to spend a few hours a week with him between classes but I wanted to do fun romantic things like going out and just being there for each other. He was all willing to do this for the boys and I just felt left out and excluded after he never makes plans or goes out his way for me like his does his boys. He goes camping, swimming, tubing, plays games with them all the time but has never done those things with me. He also just seemed off the last few weeks because he is depressed but he never talks out his problems with me. He just shuts me out.\n\nWe also had plans to do something to which last minute something came up but he didn't make an effort to do anything else and just hung out with his friend and some random girl the next day and ignored me.

I ended that relationship then and there and returned the engagement ring I had bought the next day.\n\nThen after 3 months of moping around some friends set me up on a date with a girl. That girl turned out to be deaf-mute, but with my limited knowledge of sign language, her lip reading and our phones we made it work. It was one of the most fun dates I've had ever and both me and her agreed to another date and I instantly felt an amazing connection to this girl.\n\nWe are now dating for almost 5 months and I know now that I am in a way better relationship than I have been before. I am pretty sure to say that she is the one for me and we've been progressing slowly but surely in our relationship. This is partly because of me I have become a bit more hesitant after what happened in my previous relationship, but she's been amazingly patient.\n\nI have not always had the best relationship with my parents. Seeing the gravity of my previous relationship I had yet to tell them I had been seeing someone because I did not know where we would end up. So last week I invited them to go out for dinner because I wanted them to meet my gf. I felt ready for her to meet my parents.\n\nFast forward to last night we meet my parents in a restaurant. And I introduce her to my parents and vice versa both talking and signing at the same time. I have now become somewhat decent in signing, barring the occasional funny mistake.\n\nMy parents' face instantly had this look on them that I knew something was wrong. I also tell my parents to try to look towards my gf while speaking so she can lip-read and follow along the conversation better without me having to translate every single word they say. \n\nMy parents keep this face of disapproval but we go on and sit. We go through the normal pleasantries how I am doing etc. etc. But the mood isn't pleasant, I also notice that they aren't really asking my gf any questions but all questions about her are directed at me. \"What does she do for work?\" \"Where is she from?\" And while I get that it may take some getting used to I know my parents weren't making an effort.\n\nSo dinner goes along, my gf was getting a bit uncomfortable and I know she's a bit insecure about her not being able to hear or speak. And I was getting annoyed with my parents' behaviour.\n\nSo we finish out main course and they ask me a question about her again and I reply with \"Why don't you ask her yourself?\" My mom replies to this with \"How can she understand me?\" And this is when I was done with it. I turned to my gf and in just sign language I asked her if she wanted to go and she only nodded. So we left without even saying something, I paid for the entire dinner and went home.\n\nMy gf ended up crying because of the whole ordeal and blaming herself for what happened. I just tried to comfort her and told her it wasn't her fault. \n\nThis morning I had a text message from my mom saying how rude it was to just get up and leave and how I embarrassed them infront of the people in the restaurant (we know the owners pretty well) and that I should get back together with my ex. But the thing that pisses me off the most is that she said that I was making a mistake dating a \"disabled person\" as if that is something that makes her less. \n\nI have yet to reply because I know that if I react with my gut reaction I might ruin the relationship with my parents permanently.\n\nTl;dr introduced my deaf-mute gf to my parents and they as saying it is a mistake to date a disabled person", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2091218, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My parents are saying I should not date my gf because she's deaf-mute", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570521809, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/degf0k/my_parents_are_saying_i_should_not_date_my_gf/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dumbnibba65536", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_q0vuvd5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570432969, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deg3sq/what_do_i_26m_do_when_my_wife_26f_was_raised_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "deg3sq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 48, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/deg3sq/what_do_i_26m_do_when_my_wife_26f_was_raised_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570432970, "score": 153, "selftext": "My wife comes from a very affluent family, and for me, completely opposite.

My wife is a wonderful women, she has made my life better and made me happier and many ways, but I feel like there's still a remnant of her family's traditional beliefs that she holds on to, that frankly disgust me. One of these things is how she worries about what other people will think when they ask us what our families do, and how when it comes to telling people what my family does (since they're not affluent like my wife's) she feels somewhat ashamed. For some context my wife is from a family who believe that since they have worked their way to come to this country and be the top whatever percent, they are prestigious and Royal and hold a lot of status, and a lot of these beliefs have been passed down to my wife as well. Her parents never initially approved of the marriage but eventually accepted it and went with it since she followed what made her happy. Pretty much since we've been together she assured me she sees eye to eye and us as equals despite coming from different economic classes, but sometimes in heated arguments, her emotions get revealed and she talks about how she makes more than me and how I should be happy she's with me despite being able to get a man of the same 'status'. Really hurtful stuff. When I confront her she's stating she is a product of her parents and believes what they think is right for her, etc. Our marriage isn't falling apart at all, we are happy most of the time, but the fact that I recently noticed she doesn't see eye to eye these days has me worrying if there's a possible superiority complex her parents put into her.

It was a long (70+ pages) essay? or story? can't really classify... but it was all about how disgusted he is by obesity and descriptions of what he'd do to the obese if he was in charge.\n\nI didn't read it all, just a few pages, and skimmed some of the rest. He makes up characters, that he called \"subjects\" like Subject A, Subject B, then there'd be detailed paragraphs describing the monstrosity of their body, their gluttony, and what gets done to them. Examples like one person was continuously forcefed until death, another wasn't given anything but water until they were an appropriate weight since he says the obese don't physically need food to survive. Then there was flat out violent torture scenes I won't get into. This was so incredibly disturbing to read and realize his mind is able to come up with something like this. And that he LIKES it. I saw a couple places he mentioned masturbating to what he imagines.\n\nThe entire tone of the thing also really creeped me out, some places he's just ranting almost incoherent (all caps, typos, sentences a mess) then others he's clinically precise and clear with graphic descriptions of these torture fantasies. It's like he goes from insane with anger to completely detached, back and forth.\n\nIn trying to be level about this, I should explain that both of his parents have passed away, his mom a few years ago and his dad last year, both passed away from morbid obesity. He himself is not obese or even overweight, he's very careful to avoid the behaviors and lifestyle of such because he knows the risk firsthand.\n\nSo I wonder if this is how he vents his feelings about his parents and their death?? He was always very worried about them, and frustrated when they never listened or made any changes. He never spoke about them the way he writes about obese people. He loved them very much. I'm now worried he's doing worse than I thought since they died.\n\nMy question is do I ask him about it. Do I tell him it scared me or is that overreacting? I know I was snooping as soon as I clicked it and he's a pretty private person, so I'm ashamed now to have broken his trust... if it was you would you bring it up to your partner or not? If it's about his parents I want to help him get through it.\n\nAlso 11 year marriage after 4 years relationship together.\n\nTL;DR: husband has been writing over 70 pages of angry monologue about obese people, part describing how grotesque and repulsive they are, part masturbatory revenge fantasy.

I was going to wait until October to confront her because she is a key witness in a court case I have coming up, but it was literally eating me alive. I had called my dad and talked to him about it and he he brought up a good point. She had made a written statement under oath about what had happened already. So upon realizing that I decided it was finally time to confront her.\n\nIt had only been a week since I had found out that I decided to confront her, but it was honestly one of the most uncomfortable weeks of my life. Everytime I looked at her I felt angry, every smile I made towards her was forced and faked, going to bed at night with her made me feel cold and empty and worst of all having sex with her made me feel completely and utterly disgusted with myself. I had only done it like once or twice and then made an excuse every single time after that to not have sex with her. I was literally dying on the inside. The morning of the day I confronted her she actually accused me of cheating on her and all I could do was look at her and burst out into a fit of hysterical laughter because of how ironic the situation was. It did nothing to help my case but I left my house for a good 45 minutes to make some phone calls.\n\nThat\u2019s when I called my father and decided now was the time. After calling my father I had decided to contact my wife\u2019s sister because back in October she had tried to get a hold of me about something important she had to tell me about my wife. Back then I had thought it was just some dumb bullshit (because she\u2019s a notorious liar and thief) but after what I had seen I had thought that perhaps it was genuine. After contacting her she actually warned my wife. So my wife called me and I told her I would be home shortly to confront her. \n\nI pulled up into my driveway, slipped an audio record into my pocket and turned video recording on on my phone and put that into my breast pocket then walked inside to confront her. I was cool, calm and collected but on the inside I had no idea what to expect, this woman that I had been with for years had turned into a completely different person in the past 6 months. I had confronted her by saying \u201chow long have you been cheating on me, how many people have you cheated on me with and why did you do it?\u201d.  She tried playing dumb at first but then I started quoting things she said in messages to her sister, and naming off some of the guys she had cheated on me with and her mood instantly changed and I saw that tears started to well up in her eyes. I asked her again and she refused to answer until I told her how I found it out, so I told her about how I had went through her and her sisters messages. She instantly started crying and I still don\u2019t believe half the things she told me, she said it had only been with 2 guys but the messages I saw suggest it has at least been 3 or 4 different men, she also said she had not cheated on me since March which I called her bullshit on because there was a message about how she met up with a guy at a hotel literally days before my birthday.\n\nHer reasoning for doing it was probably one of the worst excuses I have ever heard, she told me she was afraid of moving so far from home and did it out of weakness and her 2nd reason was because she had not been with someone sexually prior to me. I told her those were the dumbest excuses I ever heard and that we would be getting a divorce and she broke down and started bawling her eyes out and begging me to stay and that she couldn\u2019t lose me. I didn\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t yell at her, I didn\u2019t call her any names, I just stared at her as she cried absolutely disgusted with the woman she had become. I explained to her that there was nothing she could do, we were going to be getting a divorce and that I would let her stay at my house for 1-2 months while she saved money to move. That lasted for about 10 days then I told her she needed to leave because I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of her anymore and she went to her friends house.\n\nThe separation was cordial at first but then she started doing things that absolutely pissed me off. She would call my phone late into the night when she would know I would be sleeping to wake me up, she ended up developing this elaborate story that painted me as the bad guy saying that I \u201conly married her to get extra money and this was my plan all along, to marry her and divorce her once she was useless to me\u201d, she showed up one time at 1 in the morning to fetch her things when I had been offering to bring her things to her all damn day, after that incident I changed all the locks on the house. But what pissed me off the most was she demanded me to sign over one of my 2 cars in a separations agreement both of which I had worked extremely had to pay cash for. She insisted she needed a car to survive, that she was entitled to a car since I had originally bought it for her, that she deserved the car even though I had paid for everything the past year of the relationship and that she wasn\u2019t going to do any paperwork without me giving her the car. \n\nOut of anger I let it drag on for a few weeks before speaking with someone about it. He explained to me that losing this 2500 dollar car would be worth it in the long run especially since I have a sizable chunk of equity in my house that she isn\u2019t interested in and she was also willing to waive all rights to alimony and post separation support, the only reason I didn\u2019t want to sign the car over even though it would be the financially responsible thing to do considering how much she was willing to lose for it was because I had too much emotion and anger into it and I had to take the anger out. I decided his advice was right and now we have an appointment in a few weeks to sign the separations agreement. All she is getting from me is a car and I\u2019m getting everything else.\n\nSince leaving her I\u2019ve felt a lot of different emotions. I\u2019ve been extremely angry and lonely however, oddly enough I haven\u2019t missed her at all and haven\u2019t even thought about any of the good times we had the month-month and a half we have been apart. My house is an absolute mess and I\u2019ve been too unmotivated to clean it more than 20 minutes at a time, I spend a lot of my free time just laying in bed staring at the ceiling and walls, I got rid of all of our cats and dogs, however for the first time in a very long time I feel free again, like I can do whatever I want. Finding out she was cheating on me was just the icing on the cake, she had become verbally abusive, got into the habit of coming home drunk multiple times a week and putting her hands on me when she was drunk, hadn\u2019t helped me pay for anything for nearly a year, and became extremely irresponsible and was constantly breaking things, losing things and getting tickets that I had to pay for. So honestly this is for the best. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what will happen now or what I will do. Since leaving her I\u2019ve hooked up with multiple women I didn\u2019t even know for fun, (one of them likes me a lot now and she\u2019s a very nice and genuine girl but I have no idea what to do), went to clubs and bars for the first time, reconnected with old friends and have attempted to get my life back on track. I don\u2019t plan to get married again for a very very long time if ever, I got married too young and I\u2019ve done so much growing up this year from all I\u2019ve been through I sometimes feel disconnected from my peers and I don\u2019t even want a committed long term relationship for a while either. I made an appointment to see a counselor/therapist at the end of this month cause not only am I dealing with a divorce but I have heaps of other things going on in my life too. But I\u2019m not sure if I need it.\n\nTLDR; confronted my cheating wife, getting a divorce, learning how to be single again.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2089239, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[UPDATE] Just found out my (22M) wife (21F) has been cheating on me for the past year", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570480293, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/de8xdn/update_just_found_out_my_22m_wife_21f_has_been/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "The1Throwaway123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qpuhe6h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570391104, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/de89lx/girlfriend_19f_wants_me_20m_to_beat_her_in_bed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "de89lx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 57, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/de89lx/girlfriend_19f_wants_me_20m_to_beat_her_in_bed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570391105, "score": 301, "selftext": "(ThrowRA) Ok so, here's the deal. My girlfriend, long story short, has been horribly mistreated/abused by men in the past. The first guy she dated was essentially Christian Grey on steroids; he beat her, he restrained her, he refused to touch her in any context except sex, he hit her in public, the list goes on. She's always telling me, though, about how miserable she was with him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been the exact opposite of this guy; I've treated her exceptionally well. She knows full-well that I care about her deeply. That said, she does enjoy some rough sex. Specifically: biting, slapping, choking, scratching, and name-calling. I do too, and we've both made an agreement that we're ok with doing that, in a sexual context exclusively, to eachother. Until last night. We were getting rough, and all was well and consensual (we also have safe words in place), until she asked me to hit her. And beat her. I'm not talking about a slap; I'm talking about me closing my fist and whaling. To put it simply: she wanted to be my punching bag. And I asked her why, and she told me \"that's always how it was with the first guy, I thought this was normal). I then assured her repeatedly that it wasn't, and I went on to tell her that, in most if not all loving relationships, the guy isn't going to town on the girl and using her as an outlet for his anger and stress. She then told me \"you're just too good for me and there has to be something evil down in there, why won't you stop being so good to me\"? And I asked \"do you really want me to stop being so good?\" She thought for a second and said no, and said she was glad that I didn't end up going farther and hitting her. She also told me that she felt like she didn't do enough for me, and she felt like that if she let me beat her, I would feel better. At which point I laid out several things that she did for me (and I made sure to keep each of them non-sexual) that emotionally fulfilled me. We cuddled it out and everything was ok. \n\nBut I need advice moving forward, as well as advice on how I handled last night's incident. I made sure she was safe, I made sure she knew I wasn't mad, and I did let her know that a loving relationship, in my own opinion, wasn't/isn't based entirely off of pain and power dynamics. I told her that if she wanted somebody who was going to beat her and treat her poorly, it would be best for her to look elsewhere. And I told her, over and over, that I loved her deeply, and that I just wanted  her to be truly happy.

After that I had no idea what to do, so I woke up my older sister [21F] and asked her to help. My gf let her into the bathroom (but not me) and my sister helped her clean up and gave her supplies and a change of clothes. I thought after that my gf would come out and we could talk about it but instead she asked my sister to take her home. \n\nI texted her this morning and asked if everything is okay and told her I\u2019m not mad or anything but she hasn\u2019t replied. My sister said she was just embarrassed and scared because it was her first period and being the only child of a single father she didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I\u2019m afraid I might have looked or sounded disgusted but I just want to be able to help her.\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend started her period and freaked out.

We were solid during the week - in a text she encouraged us to go crush it (much like how we'd smashed it) - and I felt that I ought give the gals a night on the town without a third wheel rolling behind them. \n\nI got a text around 4 - are you up? I wasn't. In the morning she sends another text - can I come by - and my stomach goes ice cold. She never does this. \n\nYou guessed it. She fucked a stranger.\n\nThat's a year in the can and trust gone to shit. Tells me she's horny all the time and got drunk. Apparently cried with the guy before they did the deed (what a prize she found, seeing a woman crying about going to have cheat-sex and then goes through with it). She blames the alcohol and hormones, claims she's had a revelation about how she's taken me for granted and can't see a future without me. \n\nTo be honest, I couldn't see one without her. A small mercy is that I truly feel I did all I could - and she claims as much as well. She says she's been horrible and draining and from now will see a therapist, face the music and turn her life around. This was her lowest low and even though never she cheated before, to come back to this immature sexual need for validation in times of doubt instead of facing her issues was something she thought she left in her teenage years. She wants me back. She claims I have a choice. She wants to choose me every day and doesn't care who I tell, she's in for redemption. \n\nI will be okay. I have friends and family that closed around me instantly. We have written, and I have given her my honest feelings. I hope she gets the help she needs. I hope she doesn't use me as a bat and proof against herself, that she breaks this cycle of people treating her wrong and she telling herself she is wrong. I wish her all the love and the best in the world - we all deserve to be loved and feel safe, but I can't be that man for her any more than I can follow my own advice at this point. \n\nSo that's that. Thanks for your ear, thanks Reddit for being this vent in times of crisis. And thanks L, hope you get out of this and use this disaster as the fuel needed to propel you out of your desolation.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2088519, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[UPDATE] My girlfriend (32F) tells her friends that I'm (32M) not the one", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570466871, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/de5rbj/update_my_girlfriend_32f_tells_her_friends_that/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "scaredtotellher2019", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qnnbh4v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570372738, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/de42di/i_25m_got_raped_last_night_and_i_dont_know_how_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "de42di", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 367, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/de42di/i_25m_got_raped_last_night_and_i_dont_know_how_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570372862, "score": 634, "selftext": "Last night I went out for some drinks with a friend.

Alarm bells went off but she was alone and I thought of my gf or sister being in the same position, and since she said she lived just off the street where the bars are, I agreed. I will regret that forever. \n\nWe walked and made small talk and had a cigarette (one each), but after a while I realized I had no idea where we were. I\u2019m terrible with directions when I\u2019m sober but I\u2019d had a few beers and was even more disoriented than I\u2019d normally be. When we finally got to her house, she said she\u2019d forgotten her key and brought me around back to get her roommates to open the back door. I was super sketched out and sat down on their porch swing away from the door. She sat down next to me and tried to make a move, but I told her I have a girlfriend and that I\u2019m not interested. At that moment, the door swung open and she pulled me inside. She offered me some water and being drunk and wanting to sober up quick, I said yes. I know how stupid that was in retrospect but I was freaked out and didn\u2019t think that I was in any real danger, being a tall-ish guy. \n\nThe next thing I remember is being in her room and my pants being down and her naked. I don\u2019t know what happened just before that or right after but I think I came from whatever happened. Part of me wishes I remember because I absolutely dread the feeling of not being in control of my mind/ body but another part of me never wants to know what went down.

My back was facing the door where my table is and where the lamp is as well. I opened my eyes, only to see someone's shadow on the wall meaning that there's someone behind me.

Last week he called me from his boy\u2019s night to ask what kinds of ice cream we had at home, and I heard what sounded like over the top female moaning in the background.

I asked him if he could stop masturbating with his friends because it makes me uncomfortable and he said that he didn\u2019t want to, he didn\u2019t want me controlling how he interacts with his friends, and it was a \u201chelpful way for them to release stress.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to do.

Sorry for this being a long post. And sorry for formatting, making this post on mobile.\n\nMy and my wife have been together for 5 years and been married for 2 years. We met on a online dating site and hit it off very well. The years of dating and being engaged I never lost trust in her or it was always great. I felt loved and happy the whole time. We spend a lot of time together. Talked all the time. Cuddled and had a great sex life.\n\nA few months before we got married my wife got sick. She held off on going to the doctor for a few months about her pain. During this time she did not tell me about this pain or bring anything up. She was distance and closed off. Spending her time on phone texting. When she finally brought it up to me I told her to go to the doctor to get it looked at. All I wanted was for her to get the help she needed and do what I can do to to help.\n\nShe had a small out patient procedure before our wedding and during that time I help bandage and clean her up. She was still pushing me away and going to her phone to talk with friends instead of me. I knew she was feeling bad from the pain and from feeling like a horrible wife but I understood and told her I am always here for her and that I'm not going anywhere.\n\nGet married and go on our honeymoon. While on our honeymoon she spends all her time on her phone talking with a guy. Sending pictures of the resort and what she is doing. I was getting annoyed but knew she was in pain and this seemed her way to coop with her feelings. It got worse when we were in our hot tub on our balcony and she wants him pictures and the guy says he wishes he was there with her to hold her and kiss her. She also said she wished he was there too.\n\nI did not bring it up on the honeymoon cause I wanted to at least enjoy the relaxation and sun. When we got home I held off thinking maybe it will pass but she just kept messaging him everyday all day about everything she was doing. Being flirty, emotional, and open with him while not acknowledging me.\n\nBrought it up to her that what she was doing is making me feel uncomfortable. That they way they are talking makes me feel like a third wheel in our marriage. That she does not love me but rather loves this guy. She told me he is just a friend. Would not let me read her messages but I tried to trust her. \n\nHer sickness came back. Had a surgery and I was there to take care of her. She kept talking to him and not. I kept bring it up. She kept getting more sick from chronic migraines to falls she had while riding her horse and other pains. Go with her to doctor visits, helped paid for her treatment and everything I could to help.\n\nAgain I was there to take care of her, help her, and nurse her back to health. She would go to this other guy. When should would start feeling better we would not cuddle or kiss or anything. Pretty much 100% dead bedroom and no emotional connection at all.\n\nWith all this my depression and anxiety started to come back up with being treated as a third wheel and that I don't matter in the relationship. Had it all my life with how I was raised and all my past relationships ending with women cheating on me. Hard for me to trust with so many women cheating on me.\n\nMe going through this hit her hard cause she kept telling me \"maybe we should have held off on getting married until my depression and anxiety was gone\". That really stung and hurt so much. \n\nI started going back to therapy for myself. Getting myself better while still taking care of her, the house, the bills, the animals, etc... Started getting myself better but she was still distant and being open with this guy on her phone.\n\nWe started to go through couples therapy to work on some of our issues and they seemed to be working. We were getting closer and she was opening up little by little.\n\nI went to see my family thia weekend to work on our relationship and try to make things better with them. While I am gone our indoor camera system tells me motion is going on and I look cause I get a notification that shows another guy in it. I see a guy and hear a guy come into my house, which sounds just like the voice I have heard her talk to on her phone but lie to me about, and see home take his pants and shirt off. Go over to the couch and he lays on my wife while she cuddles him and rubs his neck and head. \n\nShe invited a stranger to me into our house with our wedding pictures on the wall right next to them and cuddles up with him. She proceeds to kiss him and he touches all over her. She made food for him and he is sitting in his boxers eating food on my couch in my house.\n\nI get so upset I take a photo through our security camera and send it to her. We have a long talk. Her explanation was she knew I put up cameras, which she already knew cause talked about it before hand to watch the dogs we own, and wanted to give me something to look at.\n\nEven then she still kissed him and was romantic and cuddly with him, in a way she has never been with me in 2 years. She says she can't trust me but I also can't trust her. She broke my trust, my respect, and hurt me so much in the same way all my other relationship have I just don't know what to do.\n\nWe ended the phone call and I need to drive back to that place, a place I can't call home now, but I don't know what to do.\n\nWhat is my next step? I still love her a lot and for me my marriage vows means something. I'm just completely broken and don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR wife has been distant since getting married. Spent all her time talking with a man on her phone. Found her and a man on our indoor security camera system cuddling and kiss on my couch. Called to talk but was told it was my fault somehow.

I couldnt control myself. He continued to say \"what am I dating\" .. \"spastic\"... i literally had to tell him i couldn't breathe.\nThen he comforted me and we fell asleep at 5am. And this morning he acted like a dick again.

I looked him dead in the eye and responded \"you're a joke\" before i turned on my heels and left. Im so proud of that moment. He then called me multiple times and agreed to move out, to his parents (i dont have family in this country). I obviously didnt answer. \n\nHow can I manage to go through with this breakup?

Over this time Dr. H and I have spent a large amount of time together working on this research, including a decent amount of one-on-one time in his office, sometimes even after campus had closed. I never really gave it much thought at the time, as I was genuinely just really excited about the prospect of doing the research. Then when it came time to sign up for classes this semester, it felt like a no-brainer to sign up for the course he was teaching, which was also the last requirement to fulfill my major.\n\nShortly after however, I started getting texts late at night from the Dean. Sometimes at 2 or 3am. These texts were usually prefaced with an academic \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in our project, but when I would follow up, there was rarely if ever anything of substance. For example, the exchange could look something like this:\n\n\u201cI think I just figured it out\u201d\n\n\u201chey that\u2019s awesome! what\u2019d you find?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really quite complex..... I can show you at our next meeting..\u201d\n\n\u201csounds good\u201d\n\nBut then he would immediately turn the conversation into something entirely non-research related. He would maybe mention something like being stressed, and needing a spa day to relax. I found it a little weird to text one of your students at 3am and then talk about a spa day, but also he is the Dean and my professor, so I\u2019d usually just say something to the affect of \u201cyeah, you work hard, you deserve the break,\u201d or some sort of generic response. If I stopped texting, he would double or triple text after maybe 5-15 minutes. Again, kinda weird, but he\u2019s the Dean so I just went along with it. It progressed from that, though.\n\nDr. H continued to text me late at night, but they got less innocent. I recall an exchange where he said he frequented a nude pool, and I obviously had no idea how to answer that text, so I didn\u2019t. Then, a few minutes later, he just texts me \u201c?\u201d, at which point I feel like I\u2019m forced to respond. I forget what I said, but it was again a generic sort of non-response. He followed that up by telling me how much I would like the nude pool. I really didn\u2019t know how to respond, so I just told him I was gonna get some sleep because I had class in the morning. I continued going to his class, and everything seemed normal, so I felt like maybe the inappropriate nature of the conversation was all in my head.\n\nI continued to stay after class fairly regularly, as did one or two of my friends. Last week however we had our first major exam, on which I thought I did incredibly well. That night, I get a text from Dr. H sometime past midnight. It starts off innocent, if not related to academics at all, but still it was fine. After like a half hour of me texting the Dean out of perceived obligation, it\u2019s suddenly not innocent anymore. He sent a text that point blank asked me if I had ever worn super short shorts, and I completely ignored that text and responded to a different text. I feel really uncomfortable, and I\u2019m just trying to exit the conversation as politely as I can, or at least divert it in some way. It doesn\u2019t work, and a few messages later he resends the EXACT same text, and expects a response. I said \u201cha, no I\u2019m not quite so daring\u201d and he seemed upset after that. Then, he started pushing the idea of my wearing an article of clothing that he\u2019s obsessed with, and it became a really weird fantasy about all of us wearing that piece of clothing when we presented our research. I cannot express how uncomfortable I was, I didn\u2019t even have a response, I just said I was tired and going to bed. When he replied he was clearly agitated, and said something like \u201cok...\u201d\n\nThat was the last time he texted me, and normally he texts me frequently. I\u2019ve been super anxious all the time since it happened. I\u2019ve been eating a lot less, I\u2019ve been unable to concentrate and do homework, and I feel dread whenever I go to his class.\n\nWe got our exams back a few days ago,and when I looked at my score, it was significantly lower than I\u2019d thought it would be. Ilooked over the exam, and the points he took off just... didn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s the equivalent of if it were a math class, and the question was \u201c2+2\u201d and when you answered \u201c4\u201d you got points off because it was the 4 that had a triangle top as opposed to the two pronged 4. I asked my friend if I could see his exam. He got a 100%, and when we compared answers, they were identical. Even my friend thought it was super weird I was getting all of these points off. There was no legitimate reason I should have lost credit on any of those questions. After class I decided I\u2019d talk to the Dean to see if he\u2019d just made a mistake or something. When I asked him why I was getting points off for certain questions, he couldn\u2019t answer me. He just stared at my test. It was apparent that he was unable to justify the points being deducted. The conversation ended when he said \u201cYou know, we need to hold you to a higher standard. The Dean has high expectations for you both.\u201d Also referencing my friend who hung back with me as I asked Dr. H about my test. The Dean then offered to give me 3 points back, which is an essentially meaningless amount of points, and I told him I didn\u2019t care about the points, he could take 10 more if he wanted. I didn\u2019t care. I left the classroom.\n\nWhen I checked the grade book later, he\u2019d given me an extra point. I don\u2019t know why, but this is the exact moment I felt powerless. The anxious horrible feeling I had all week was legitimate. This person that I\u2019ve respected and looked up to is not a good man. I feel stupid. Like really, really, really fucking stupid. I work at the school, and in the time that I\u2019ve worked there, I\u2019ve been promoted two times. This is not only an anomaly, but it just doesn\u2019t happen. I work in the Dean\u2019s department, and not to sound up my own ass, but I\u2019m very good at my job. It made sense to me that I was getting promoted, but now I feel like I never earned any of it. Anytime that I would run a suggestion by the Dean, it would be implemented by the end of the week. Dr. H would make himself constantly available, and always tried to make me feel special. It just feels gross now. Two weeks ago I loved that stupid school, and I loved my stupid job, and I loved that stupid class, and now I\u2019m just anxious all the time.\n\nThis man controls my ability to graduate. In order for me to get my degree, he needs to sign off on a routine course replacement. The deadline for that is a while away, and before then, I need to agree to present our research a few states away. Not only that, but he apparently has no qualms maliciously taking away the marks I earn.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I have no one to go to about this. The Dean is in charge of handling \u201cmisconduct\u201d like this, but for obvious reasons that is not at option. The Associate Dean is good friends with Dr. H, and I don\u2019t think it would end well for me. I have a great relationship with the staff at the school and all my other professors in the department, but they would have to report what I said to the Dean if I asked them for help because of the way the system is setup. If I reported elsewhere, I\u2019m worried about what will happen to me, and my ability to graduate. I\u2019ve worked so hard, and I feel like it\u2019s all gonna be taken away.\n\nI\u2019m also worried because the professor who I am closest to and consider a mentor, is drinking buddies with the Dean. The professor (who I will call Mr. R) has gone above and beyond for me. Mr. R gave me his textbook when I was in between paychecks, recommended me for scholarships, and helped me apply for the job I have at the school. He was even the one that told the Dean to choose me for the undergraduate research. I trust Mr. R a lot, he\u2019s been nothing but great to me, and I feel like if I report Dr. H I\u2019ll be betraying both of them. I\u2019m mostly worried doing so would cost me the relationship with Mr. R. Nothing would have ever happened Mr. R hadn\u2019t been nice enough to recommend me, and I would feel incredibly guilty getting his friend in trouble. Ialso, in the back of my mind, worry that Mr. R knew about Dr. H. I really don\u2019t think he did, but it makes me a little hesitant to turn to Mr. R for advice about this.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I want to drop out. I just feel so powerless. I really think my only option is to keep going to class, and not responding to the Dean other than through official channels such as school email. I feel selfish not doing anything. If it\u2019s just me, like it sucks for me or whatever, but I can tough it out for the next 10 weeks if I have to. As I think about it though, I realize there\u2019s almost no way it\u2019s just me. He\u2019s either done this before, will do it again, or both.\n\nWhich brings me to perhaps my main concern. I am incredibly worried about my friend who is in the same class as I am with the Dean. He stays after class sometimes, and frequently wears the piece of clothing the Dean was far too infatuated with. My friend is 18, it\u2019s his first semester, and so far his only friends are myself and the Dean. He told me that it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s felt like he belonged somewhere in a while. I don\u2019t know how to ask my friend if the Dean has ever said anything weird, or how to warn him. I\u2019m worried the Dean is already grooming this kid.\n\nI just feel like there\u2019s not a good answer to any of this, and there\u2019s no result that doesn\u2019t ruin my life for a little while. I only yesterday was able to tell my girlfriend what had been happening, and I have no idea how I\u2019d ever be able to explain it to my parents. I\u2019m also a childhood abuse victim, and this entire situation has really amplified a lot of the helplessness I felt as a kid. I don\u2019t know how I basically let it happen again, I just feel so fucking dumb. There\u2019s a lot of instances of behavior that I feel were inappropriate on the part of Dr. H, but it would be a much longer post to chronicle all of it.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read, really any advice is appreciated, I am completely lost on what to do here. I do my best to always do the right thing, but I'm not even sure what \"right\" is anymore. It's hard to be objective given the circumstances, so I would really like some help sorting it out.\n\nTL;DR: The Dean has acted inappropriately towards me, and retaliated when I didn\u2019t reciprocate.

A little back story - she broke up with me on June 19th, we had been together for about 4.5 years. I was at work and it was out of nowhere. I got home from work around 5pm that day obviously upset, told her I was taking my stuff and going to my moms. I tried to take my PS4 (which she uses regularly) and she got mad and said \u201cif you take that i\u2019m taking your phone, since I pay the bill\u201d so I said fuck it and gave her my phone. I got it back an hour later because I didn\u2019t ever end up leaving.\n\nFast forward to now and I\u2019m over her. In an amazing new relationship and as happy as can be. I got on my Instagram last night for the first time since January. There were some messages sent from me to some account I definitely didn\u2019t recognize. 3 in total, along the lines of \u201cwhy are you trying to break my family up, you look like you\u2019re in high school. you\u2019re not going to raise my son\u201d stuff like that. Stuff I never said or have any recollection of doing. It was also definitely not how I type. I was extremely confused and started looking at the account it was sent to. Noticed a couple things on the account that stood out to me and made me realize it was my babymomma\u2019s boyfriend. I looked at the dates and realized she sent those from my phone on the day she had my phone, at 5:48pm. I guess trying to make it seem like I was trying to start drama? She won\u2019t admit to it and is saying \u201coh you were probably drunk\u201d when that\u2019s definitely not the case. \n\nThis guy looked REALLY young. And obviously in high school like it stated on his profile. I was concerned show I showed my girlfriend, she dug and found out her little brother is friends with him. This morning her brother confirmed that he is in fact 16. \n\nMy babymomma is 24. Having sex with a 16 year old in my apartment, with MY name on the lease. I don\u2019t want any part of this. This is illegal as hell. I don\u2019t want anything happening where my little guy could get taken away. \n\nWe don\u2019t have another place to go right now. I called her out on it and she admitted to everything. I have screenshots and screenshots of proof. Texas btw. \n\nWhat the hell do I do.

He owns his own business as a carpenter, so he can totally make is own schedule. I work full time in a very high responsibility position, making a great living - but I work a lot. In addition to work, I also do ALL of the parenting, household care, handle all of the bills, grocery shop, scheduling, school work, sports (my daughter trains 7 days a week in gymnastics), all medical visits (my daughter has chronic illness requiring at least 1-2 visits every month) - basically everything that an at home parent would do, while working about 45-50 hours a week outside of the home.

Our daughter basically does not expect anything from him anymore, but she begs me not to divorce him. He spends zero time with me or our daughter. He sits at his shop across town, drinks beer and builds furniture 7 days a week.\n\nPS - this has been going on for quite a while. I do not put up with his bullshit and hold him accountable for his actions. I do A LOT to take care of him and he acknowledges that... but still treats me like an option, not a priority.

While I did get a few answers then, I still haven't given an answer and need all the advice I can get. \n\nFor the sake of privacy I'll have to be kind of vague and omit some details. Long story short, my husband's best friend, who we'll call T, was seriously injured in a work-related accident a almost two months ago. He's been in the hospital since then and spent most of his time in the ICU, only being moved to the 'regular' floor. When he was first admitted, he had a mile long list of injuries that have, for the most part, healed enough that he's been cleared to go home...on the condition he has someone to help with his care. This is where things have gotten complicated. T's wife cheated on and divorced him and a couple years ago and his only family is his 80 y/o grandmother. There *is* no one to else to help him...except me.\n\nMy husband has been diligently by T's side throughout this ordeal. He went to the hospital almost every day to the point he's on a first name basis with the nurses and has done everything in his power to help T. He's like family and we both care for him greatly so without even thinking, and WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO ME BEFOREHAND, my dear husband suggested right there in front of T that I could be his caregiver. Don't worry, that's not what this post is about - we've discussed this since then and he knows that was a real jerk move. He can't do it himself because of work and it just kind of slipped out because he's eager to help.\n\nNevertheless, I've been really put on the spot. T has been very bashful and I think he feels bad about the idea too, but obviously he wants to leave the hospital. Nobody wants to stay any longer than they have to, but this is also America and at this rate his grandchildren will be paying his hospital bills fifty years from now. From the first moment my husband suggested this, a siren was just going off in my head. I've been extremely uncomfortable with the idea since the start. Don't get me wrong, I love T, he's like family, I just don't think I can handle taking care of him. For one thing there's nowhere for him to stay with us. We can't just plop him on the couch and we have no guest bedroom. Secondly, I am already a stay-at-home mom to two year old twin boys. And third, I've never been a caregiver for an adult in any capacity. We're not talking like, giving him meals and reminding him to take his medication. T is still severely injured, he has basically zero independence right now. He has a broken right arm and broken left leg, which has pretty much fucked him over on doing anything for himself. He has second degree burns over his legs and the bandages need to be changed 2+ times daily. He can't cook for himself, dress himself, bathe himself, or otherwise do much of anything besides lay and watch TV. \n\nThis would be a full time job and honestly I just don't think I'm up for it. Besides the aforementioned, I just feel like it's gonna be really awkward. On top of all the physical problems, T is already struggling hardcore with trauma from the event (showing budding PTSD symptoms), how slow his recovery is going and feeling like a burden but refuses to see a therapist. I'm just not qualified to deal with any of this in any way. The problem is unless I step up, T will probably have to be moved to basically a nursing home at thirty six years old. We are in a rural area, small town, there aren't any regular adult assisted living, just straight up nursing homes. The hospital has said there are two places he could go to and they'd both take about $3500 a month out of pocket. Word has gotten out and now I have his other friends, grandma, ex wife, not so subtly hinting they want to know if view made up my mind. And his daughters (who are 15, 13, and 7) would be staying over three days/nights a week since that's how they do their custody/visitation stuff.\n\nI just don't know what to do. He's not even in my care yet and I already feel completely overwhelmed and stressed to the max. The thought of having to tell T I can't do it, knowing I'm banishing him to a nursing home and bills that will further his ridiculous debt am not seeing his kids as much just makes me want to scream. I don't want to do this to him and upset everybody but what else can I do?\n\n** TL;DR: Husband's best friend was severely injured and unless I step up to be his caregiver, he will be moved to a nursing home where he'll have to pay $3500 a month out of pocket, lose visitation time with his kids, and nobody wants to be in a nursing home st 36 anyway. The problem is I don't think I can handle it. I'd have to help him with everything 24/7 (except when my husband is home) on top of stay at home momming twin two year old boys. I have no experience with this kind of thing and just don't feel like I can handle it.

She would stay with me Sunday night- Friday morning then go out of town to her adopted parent's house. This lasted for two college semesters and then she was living full time with me. We get along really well. We like the same shows, have the same humor, even got a kitten together that is now the sweetest cat. I am self employed and normally work my work schedule around hers so we can spend a lot of time together. She is honestly the best thing that has ever come into my life. We still plan our future life together and I can't really see mine without her.  It was only around 4 months into our relationship that she proposed to me and I happily said yes. \n\n   My fianc\u00e9 opened up to me about how she was sexually abused for years as a kid. She was taken out of that house due to other reasons with her other siblings. After 1 year of being in the system an older couple adopted her and her other 2 siblings. They raised her for around 10 years so she sees them more as parents than her biological ones. \n\n   Early on in our relationship we were very sexually active. I was really happy even though the majority of times it would take me a really long time to orgasm. I didn't really think much of it since I always hear about how bad it is when a guy finishes too fast. It wasn't until 6 months or so when that changed. We were at a friends house and were drinking a lot of wine. There were 4 girls there my Fiance was bestfriends with since high school and one other guy who was dating one of them at the party. The girls were all in relationships and started talking about their S/O. One girl brought up how she feels like sex is sort of a chore. She says she feels like she has to do it since she is in a relationship but would rather just sleep if she could. That was when my Fianc\u00e9 chimed in and said, \"I totally get it. Sometimes I feel like I want to have a quicky before bed but it just always drags on forever.\" That instantly just felt like a shot to me since I never thought it was a bad thing since she always seems like she was enjoying it.\n\n   Throughout the next few months I slowly started pulling away sexually. When we would have sex I would start overthinking that I was taking too long so I would just stop when she would orgasm. It was more than a month doing this when she asked if I came to. I told her I haven't been for over a month. We started talking about what she said at the party and how I can't get it out of my head. That was when she tried to soothe me by telling me back then we were having sex too much. She said half the time she didn't even want to do it then but felt obligated. That was why she said what she said at the party. That made me visibly sad. When I asked her why did it with me even when she didn't want to, she said it was because of what happened to her as a kid. She felt like she couldn't say no. \n\nAfter that I totally started second guessing all my sexual thoughts since I didn't want to make her do what she didn't want to do. I soon just stopped making any first moves and would only follow her lead. There were week gaps between sex, followed by a month. In all those times I didn't orgasm at all. The last time we had sex was around 6 months ago. She has tried a couple times and each time I told her I don't want to either cause I am tired or some other excuse. She hardly tries to make the first move anymore. Our 2 year anniversary is coming up and I know she is expecting us to have sex on it since she has been going go the doctors for new birth control that she says is for our trip. We are staying a few nights in a hotel and I would rather have a good time exploring the city than stressing over sex.

She uses a wheelchair but can walk if necessary. She has a personality (a very big, wonderful one\u2014she\u2019s bubbly and cheeky, blunt and funny) and can understand most things. She reads at a third grade level, can do math at a second grade level, understands social norms etc. She communicates through sign language as she\u2019s profoundly deaf. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to kind of pinpoint her developmental age. In some areas, she\u2019s where she should be. In others, she\u2019s a toddler. She loves shopping and attention and celebrities and showing off, so I\u2019d say she\u2019s at a 12/13 year old level in a lot of other stuff. \n\nWhile my family is kind of split on religion, we think it\u2019d be nice for her to think/know there\u2019s a beautiful place you go to after you die. We want her to feel safe to go, to know there\u2019s peace and that she\u2019ll be going to join our aunt and godmother who passed earlier this year. \n\nIt\u2019s just very hard to explain it to her. We don\u2019t want her to know she\u2019s dying because we don\u2019t want her to be afraid. I understand a lot of what I\u2019m saying is controversial, but that\u2019s what we think is best. We are open to suggestions, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. The thing is, I don\u2019t know the best ways to express to her that she can start letting go now. That she can stop fighting if she wants to. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know what she\u2019ll be able to comprehend and what she won\u2019t. But I guess what I\u2019m really asking is how would you deal with it if you had a child or sibling between 3-9 who was dying, what would you tell them? How would you break the news to the rest of the family? \n\nAs of now, only myself, my mother and my brothers know. Father isn\u2019t in the picture. We\u2019re heading down in four days to the city that the majority of my cousins/aunts/uncles/remaining grandparent live in to break the news to them and let them have a week with her, then we\u2019ll bring her back home. It\u2019s very clear that she\u2019s deteriorating quickly. She sleeps a lot, is virtually bedbound, and the doctors have her on several different types of pain management (including medical marijuana, which is near to impossible to get in my [Australian] state unless you are terminal). That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking this trip now.\n\nI also want to know what else I can do. I\u2019m trying to think of things I\u2019ll want to do with her before she goes, but it\u2019s hard because of how much time she has to spend resting. I\u2019m devastated, because I wasted so much of my life hating her, resenting her for the attention she took away from me. If you go back to my first ever post on this account you can even see I wished she\u2019d died\u2014and now, this pain can\u2019t even be put into words. I didn\u2019t think anything could hurt this bad. I\u2019ve literally been shaking the whole time while writing this. \n\nIt\u2019s only really in the past 7-ish years that I\u2019ve started trying to work on my relationship with her, and it\u2019s only been in the past 2 years since making that post that I\u2019ve grown to absolutely love her. I adore her. She\u2019s my best friend. We\u2019re both huge fans of Demi Lovato\u2014that\u2019s what we actually bonded over initially. I went to see Demi in concert when I was 14 and she came to Australia, but my sister hadn\u2019t been able to come because she was in the hospital. \n\nMy mother and I just thought she\u2019d be able to see her next time Demi toured in Australia. My mum even tried to use my sister\u2019s Make a Wish to meet her (as we both became fans when I was 12, my sister would\u2019ve been 16 and my mum had saved up her Make a Wish her whole life so she could use it on something my sister *really* wanted instead of wasting it) but for reasons I don\u2019t know they couldn\u2019t do it (again, I was 12 so I was just told Make a Wish couldn\u2019t make it happen; I think it was lack of funds?) And now she\u2019ll never get to see her. \n\nIt seems so unfair that I\u2019m the one who got to see her, and my sister will never be able to. My sister\u2019s literally deaf, Demi\u2019s voice is the only one she\u2019s ever been able to hear, so why am I the one who got to see her? She\u2019ll never get the chance now. She\u2019ll never get to see me have babies (and this girl absolutely *adores* babies) or get married (I would\u2019ve made her my maid of honour so she could have had just as much attention as me, because we know how much she would\u2019ve had a big beautiful wedding if she could; my sister\u2019s an attention loving diva and she deserves that so much). She\u2019ll never get any of this. \n\nAnd our birthdays are four days apart, we\u2019ve *always* celebrated them together. From my first birthday, there\u2019s photos of us blowing out our candles together. I\u2019d always hated sharing my birthday with her, but who the hell will I share it with now? \n\nSo what can we do with the time we have left? I know a lot of people will probably suggest the type of stuff you see in the news\u2014a big celebration in her honour as a kind of pseudo wedding to give her the attention and \u2018big day\u2019 that she would love, take her to meet Demi Lovato, go on a shopping trip etc. but as of right now Demi\u2019s responded to none of my attempts to get her attention and we\u2019re so busy trying to focus on my sister that we\u2019ve kind of given up in that respect. \n\nWe can\u2019t afford a big celebration or shopping haul despite making use of the help available to us. We\u2019re hoping this trip down to see our family will be nice for her but what else can I do? I\u2019ve already had her draw a \u2018Lovatic heart\u2019 (it\u2019s a heart that\u2019s kind of Demi Lovato\u2019s signature) for me to get tatted on me (years from now... I know my mum will see this post when I\u2019m inevitably likely asked for evidence of my situation and I have to explain to my mum why I need proof of my sister\u2019s diagnosis, so I promise I won\u2019t get it done til I\u2019m 25 mum) along with her name. We\u2019re taking a lot of photos and videos, doing smallish things like having her tye-dye baby clothes for future babies and shirts for us, paint things that we can hang up. It\u2019s fun for her but with an underlying thing that we can hang on to. We\u2019re bringing her friends all in to see her as much as possible, is there anything else that we can do?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2084229, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (19f) sister (23f) was just diagnosed as terminal.

He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like \"Haha, didn't we just eat?\" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says \"C'mon, please? I want something sweet.\", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say \"Well, that could've gone a lot worse.\" As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.\n\nI feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it.

Everything is good with my boyfriend and I, and same with his mom. They have a fabulous relationship and I have a great one with her too. I also want to say I suffer with some pretty severe anxiety which is part of the reason this is such a huge deal.\n\nSo I've had very thick dark curly hair for ever. It's hard to manage and my whole life I've never been to a salon that could ever get it really right. I'm not just talking colour, I'm talking hair cuts too. It's just difficult to handle. I've been dying my hair black for a long time, but recently decided I wanted to stop dying it to save money and just grow out my natural. I was at the point where about 4-5 inches of my hair was my natural dark brown, and the rest was jet black. I figured I could get a balayage (for those of you that don't know, it's kind of like a gradual shift from darker to lighter hair, like a gradient except more subtle) and I would have a nice new fresh look, and still be able to look nice while growing out my natural hair. \n\nI was looking around at salons, and I went to a place that quoted me almost $300 to do all this. I was going to go and pay the money there, but my boyfriend said \"why don't you just have my mom do it?\" I immediately thought that it wasn't a great idea because if I didn't like it I'd be screwed and in an awkward position (and here I am).\n\nI've seen her do hair, she's not a bad hairdresser, I just think something went wrong in the bleaching/toning process. Anyways, my boyfriend (thinking he was being helpful) mentioned it when we were all together \"hey mom! Acezippy needs her hair done do you think you could do what she wants and fit her in?\" \"Yes sure I have my book lets put you in so we don't forget.\" And that was that. \n\nI get to the salon and I show her a photo of a girl with dark brown hair thats just SLIGHTLY lighter brown on the bottom. Very subtle. I figured I'd choose something very very minimal so that way if it DID get messed up it wouldn't be that far off from where I was. I was wrong. I'm sitting here about to go to work with my hair in the tightest bun possible hoping my coworkers don't notice.\n\nThe bleach lifted my hair very quickly and I've been left with orange/blonde streaks all over my hair. I think I could deal if it was all one colour at least, but there are spots of dark still that look like leapord spots. (I'll link pics in the comments of what I asked for VS what I got).\n\nI feel awful because it's his mom, and I would feel terrible going somewhere else to get it fixed without telling her (she'd know because we see her all the time) but I feel so so horrible about my hair. I confided in my boyfriend last night and he said to just tell her and that he agrees it looks botched. Easier said than done. I feel like a loser because I totally did the \"oh wow yeah I love it!\" right as I left (thanks anxiety) and immediately cried after. What I really want is to just get it fixed somewhere else and for her to just not notice but obviously that's not going to happen. Again, I'm reluctant to have her do it again because she said when I come back they would just darken it, but now I've got some light spots and some dark spots and it's just so not even.... Oh...and did I mention - she did it for free? I feel like an orange bag of wieners. :( \n\nI truly don't know what to do - any advice appreciated. :(", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2083729, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (25f) boyfriends(28m) mother(50sf) is a hair dresser and I left the salon in tears", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570366311, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddmvcg/my_25f_boyfriends28m_mother50sf_is_a_hair_dresser/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shhark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6oxsq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570274412, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddlx4d/my_bf_locked_me_out_of_our_apartment_and_theres_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ddlx4d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 28, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddlx4d/my_bf_locked_me_out_of_our_apartment_and_theres_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570274472, "score": 225, "selftext": "My (ex) bf [31] and I [26f] have been having a rocky last few months because he kept lying to me about his drug and alcohol problems.

It was a great place, excellent teachers, made lots of friends who are still my best friends today. This was the time when I first saw him. Let's call him Alan. No, he wasn't a student. He was a science teacher. Okay, don't freak out. Nothing creepy happens. And in the very beginning, he wasn't even my teacher. He taught chemistry to older students. \n\nWhen I was 13, my parents took me out of school and hired private tutors instead. My family was busy and traveled regularly, so I needed more flexible schooling. Alan had a reputation for being a really excellent instructor, so my dad managed to hire him. We usually met about 3x a week for math and science lessons. In the beginning, he actually kind of stressed me out. He was serious about the lessons and had high expectations. Eventually, I worked through it and got with the program. Alan was happy to see me progressing, and our lessons became really fun and interesting for me.\n\nJump forward to when I was 17. I was still Alan's student, but he treated more and more like an equal, like a peer. It was great! I was excelling. Alan was also quite close to my family now, too. As a chemist, he was able to advise my dad and assist him in his company. It wasn't unusual for Alan to go to meetings with my dad, or join my family for dinner. Now Alan and I were very close. Maybe I even had a bit of a crush on him. But again, nothing creepy, I promise. \n\nThen one day, I was at home making some lunch with just a couple other people in the house, Alan was one of them. I accidentally cut my hand with a kitchen knife. I was pretty freaked out by all the blood, it looked worse than it really was. So Alan cleaned it up for me and bandaged my hand. In that moment, I was hit by some really strong feelings like a punch in the gut. I think I was frowning in confusion, but it probably just looked like pain. Alan laughed and told me to be more careful. He kissed my forehead, gave me a quick one-armed squeeze around the shoulders, and left the room. He'd never done that before, and I knew he didn't mean it romantically. But from then on, my feelings for him just continued to grow. This was when I started falling in love with him.\n\nI finished high school the next year, but Alan stayed in the picture. He still assists my dad and is a friend of the family. Sometimes he helped me with my university homework. I'm 27 now and he's one of my oldest and closest friends. Alan is 46. You can see why this is complicated. I feel so warm when I'm with him. My stomach turns to butterflies whenever he touches me. A kiss on the cheek, a hug, and hand on the knee during a serious discussion. Now that I'm older and we are friends, casual touching is fine and not inappropriate. I feel so close to him and sometimes I think he might feel for me, too. He's just so polite, he would never push it. Given our long past, it's really hard for me to tell him how I feel. How do I do this?\n\nAlso: I have dated in the past, nothing ever became very serious. At the end of the day, all I ever want is Alan.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2083475, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've secretly been in love with a man for a decade.

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.\n\nI could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him \u201cHoney I have to take care of him before you, you know that\u201d. And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said \u201cif you love him so much, why don\u2019t you suck his dick instead of mine\u201d. I couldn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t know what to say. He stormed out of our bedroom.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to think of this, what should I? What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it\u2019s going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don\u2019t have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being crazy?

I used to take him to my gym but once he asked the establishment to turn down their music, and another time he talked to a manager about a guy using machine too long. If we\u2019re eating out and a person or a kid is listening to videos, he\u2019ll go out of his way to tell them or the parents to turn it down. I told him that this makes me uncomfortable because it draws unwanted negative attention on us.\n\nI usually wait out annoying things because they always resolve themselves, but he believes he has to get involved or \u201cpeople won\u2019t learn and they\u2019ll think it\u2019s okay to do and continue doing it,\u201d. He does this when I\u2019m not around and tells me about it. He took his parents out to eat and got into an argument with another family eating for a loud cell phone. He was eating out alone twice and had the same thing happened, but says worse things like, \u201cyour kids are going to grow up to hate you,.\u201d If I were that kid hearing that I would be terrified. \n\nSo I started an argument about how embarrassing it is to be put in negative situations so often. I nearly broke up with him but he apologized and said he realized it was a problem and had been trying to fix it. I didn\u2019t really believe it but I gave him the benefit of the doubt\n\nOnly two days pass and we go to see a movie I had been looking VERY forward to seeing, I bought us tickets. It\u2019s at a theater with a strict no talking policy, if someone\u2019s talking you fold a white note and sit it at the end of your table and a manager takes care of it. So we get to the theater, i order us food, up until this point everything\u2019s chill. The movie starts and less than 30 seconds in my boyfriend fully raises his arm with a card as high as possible. I try to pry his arm down be he won\u2019t budge, I start to panic at the situation. A flustered manager runs over and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir your server will be right with you,\u201d and he says \u201cthis table won\u2019t stop talking,\u201d the manager huffs and lets the table know the strict no talking policy. The table was directly to the right of us. My adrenaline is through the roof and he realizes I\u2019m feeling uncomfortable and tries to be overly nice the entire movie. I can hardly watch it because of my panic. \n\nOnce the movie ended the couple he told to stop talking walks by us and the woman angrily says, \u201cyou\u2019re a douche!\u201d my boyfriend is still oblivious. I say to give them some time so we don\u2019t meet up and get into a fight but he keeps urging me to follow. Once we\u2019re in the parking lot the car with the angry couple drives by and shouts another mean thing at us. I get into my car explode and explain this was the final straw and that I\u2019m no longer comfortable going out anywhere with him.

He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me \"it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!\" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.\n\n\nIf it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it.

One particular time I returned home from the bar(after asking permission) and she was still mad and had been drinking alone. She demanded that I talk to her but I was tired and just wanted to sleep. She began hitting me and and slapping me repeatedly. I asked her for about 10 minutes to stop before I finally \"pushed\" her off me in defense of myself. There have been other altercations where she has blocked me from leaving my room when I needed to cool down.

She would throw herself against the door and hurt herself in an attempt to keep me barred in. \n\nShe went to the police and has fabricated this story with no accounts of what had happened. Her accounts basically claim that I get angry and beat her which is completely wrong. She told me surprisingly (3 weeks after the incident) that she filed a statement against me in an effort to \"make me change\". She also contacted my family and hers to let them know. \n\nShe's also blaming me for bruises on her legs that she's accumulated from being clumsy. I'm not sure how to react. I asked her why but her answers don't make any sense. She has been loving and sweet and even wrote me a love note recently. I am so utterly confused as to why she is doing this.\n\nI now have to go defend myself in a statement to police.

This will be the final update. Its been 3 months and i feel like i can give another update. Most if not all of you probably dont care or have forgot, but hey, if anyone wants to know. I haven're responded to most private messages because I didn't feel good enough, talking about it. I still kinda don't. To address the elephant in the room: my wife is back with us. She is at home and well and she laughs about the whole incident. More than I do, to be honest but thats just me. \n\nShe immediately started her treatment at the mental health institute. At first, they kept her sealed off from me and the rest of her family and friends. They taught her relations and how the brain works and how to process love and affection and all stuff like that. Meanwhile I was at home and biting my fingernails away, while explaining to everyone what is happening. Turns out that many people I know and thought highly of, dont believe in psychological damage and mental problems so that was fun talking about too. Anyway this isnt really about me here. They somehow convinced her that she has a delusion. Appareantly she almost immediately believed them but said, she still doesnt feel anything towards us, even if she knows that its a delusion. Her trust in doctors and nurses made all of this so much simpler and im so grateful for this. They worked with her more and let her first talk to her parents over the phone. She started gaining trust again and they kinda re-bonded. Later they allowed me to talk to her and I wasn't able to say a single word because i basically broke down in tears when i heard her saying or more like asking a simple \"hello?\". She told me, it will be fine and she just needs some more time and that the doctors know what they are doing. I regained some strength and told her she should call whenever she wants to. Later she talked to the kids and it really helped her. She laughed with them told them jokes about mental health and recollected some memories. Gradually, they let her meet her friends, then her parents, her siblings and finally me and the kids. That was almost 5 weeks after she got turned in. When she saw me and the kids she started to cry too and kissed all of us. She said she was sorry but i assured her there is nothing to be sorry about. They still kept her a couple of days for some final tests and let her finally go. She got back into work fairly quickly and we have the great relation that we had before all of this. The kids are happy, still dont 100% know what exactly happened. There are still some traces of distrust in herself. She questions her feelings more often and glooms over stuff but all in all, everything turned out to be good. Also, it's still not 100% clear why it happened at all. She cant recall banging her head against anything or anything different. \n\nIt feels good writing this down. I wanted to thank everyone who answered and helped me on the initial post. Rhanks to the people that almost immediately diagnosed her and made me call the police. Im sorry that I didnt answer your private messages. I was quite busy and talking about the mental health of my wife feels weird and bitter to me. She knows about this post and about the last posts and sends her love too.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2081121, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Final Update] Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570288285, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd8o63/final_update_wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cam86", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_dz6l0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570201878, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd8o1h/i_33m_was_cheated_on_by_my_partner_of_9_years_32f/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dd8o1h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 98, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd8o1h/i_33m_was_cheated_on_by_my_partner_of_9_years_32f/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570201879, "score": 199, "selftext": "TL;DR Partner of 9 years has cheated and I'm struggling to cope especially with the image of her and the guy\n\n\nMy partner and I have been together for 9 years. We have a 6 year old son. Like all relationships we've had our ups and downs. About a year ago she went away to visit a friend for the weekend and kissed a guy at a bar. She also took his number and messaged him. I found out by checking her phone (I know that's not ok) but when she spoke with me from her weekend away she seemed odd so I knew something had happened. I dropped hints and tried to get her to admit it but she wouldn't. After a week or so I confronted her and she admitted it. She apologised and I forgave her. We discussed having another child which I said I would think about. I initially said no due to concerns for the future. Not relationshio concerns, general economic concerns etc. She then said it may lead to the end of the relationship if we wanted different things. I decided my concerns weren't worth losing my family over so agreed to another child. As far as I was aware we were making plans for the future.\n\nAnyway last Saturday she was supposed to go to a friend's house after work but said friend cancelled. I said we could go to cinema or something instead and she would think about it. Just before she finished work she called to say she would like to go out for a drink with a different friend and one of the guys from work as it had been a tough day. Looking back it was an obvious lie as she had already told me her friend had no babysitter and she doesn't really like the guy from work but like an idiot I believed her. I got a message from her at 6:30 in the evening and didn't hear from her after. I didn't want to seem like a possessive partner so I didn't try any contact until 8:30 as she said she might meet me and do something as our son was at a sleep over. She didn't respond so I tried to contact her. She hadn't been on messenger and wasn't responding to calls or texts. This is extremely unusual for her so I was quite worried. Between 10:30 and 04:45 when she got home I tried calling around 30 times and texted too. Some calls were cancelled by her. The following morning she admitted that what had actually happened was she went out with a guy she had been messaging for a few weeks went back to his flat and had sex. She said she had got top drunk and lost her phone. She admitted that she knew he may try something but intended on turning him down but let herself get too drunk. She also said she wanted to separate anyway and had for a few months and this was her way out. Despite making plans for the future.\n\nAnyway we are still living together. I have told her this is what she wants so she has to sort out how we separate e.g. mortgages, selling house, car payments etc. She hadsn't done anything yet. \n\nThe advice I need is how to get over this. I suffer from severe depression anyway so this has destroyed me. I feel humiliated and betrayed. My family is gone and I feel I have nothing left. I don't really have any friends and am not close with my family but was quite close to hers so have lost that too. She said she would move out but hasn't yet and I know it's because she would have to admit to her family what she did if she was the one to move out. But the worse part is the images. All day long the though of him and her together is in my head and I can't stop it.

It became a turbulent point in my life. The girl he cheated with was much younger and had the high school attitude to match. She made life quite difficult for me in the first instance, this wasn\u2019t helped by the fact my partner and I had just signed a renewal on a house lease, leaving us stuck under the same roof for six months after the break up. It was a difficult time and I\u2019m not ashamed to say I fell into a pattern of self-harm, I am ashamed to say I we hooked up a few times during that six months, but it was an emotionally difficult and confusing time so I\u2019ll cut myself some slack. \n\nAnyhow I eventually managed to move out before the tenancy expired, and started a fresh in a new town. I was still continually plagued by this girl. Constantly messaging wanting to talk about what had happened, I should add that by this point they were an item. I was trying to move on with my life but was continually plagued by her. Despite blocking her in everyway possible (Across social media, phone numbers and email) she would always find a new way to reach me, often by setting up new email addresses and continuing to message me. I suppose looking back I should have changed my email address but I had a lot attached to it so it would have been a huge faff. \n\nThe harassing continued, in the form of regular messaging, it was often complete nonsense, wanting to know if I still had feelings for my ex, wanting to ask how I was doing, what I was up to, wanting to tell me how messed up her life was, how much she was struggling, how difficult this was on her. It was always from a self-centred stance. After the initial annoyance of receiving the messages I always tried to respond in a polite manner, a leave me alone and move on with your life type response and then block her on whatever method she chose to contact me on, I felt sorry for her that she was feeling like this but pulling it back up continually wasn\u2019t helping me either. This continued off and on up until two years ago when it seemed I had finally got her off my back and she found herself a new hobby. I heard from a mutual friend recently (Probably three months or so ago) that they\u2019d had a baby together and honestly I was so happy for my ex, it almost justified all that happened as something had come of it. I don\u2019t wish him any ill, there has been a lot of water under the bridge since then and I think having this crazy girl as his partner is enough for anyone to suffer! \ud83d\ude0a \n\nSo all was going fine, until yesterday, when the narcissist of Christmas past appeared. I was at work when my phone buzzed into life and I\u2019m greeted by a Facebook message from her. I honestly don\u2019t even know how she\u2019s managed to get through to me, I can only assume by setting up a new profile, but I guess that\u2019s besides the point, she managed. I instantly had a wave of sickness pass over me. The message was \u2018her last attempt to get through to me\u2019 she acknowledges in the message the multiple times I\u2019ve asked her to leave me alone, which I\u2019ve always done politely. She wanted to apologise for everything she put me through, that she was young and selfish and that she was in self destruct mode, but that her hurting me had taught her so many lessons and she believes she\u2019s become a better person for it, the pain and misery she caused me was the wake up she needed and that she will never forgive herself. \n\nAgain a message which was entirely self-absorbed masquerading as an apology and opportunity for forgiveness. Previously whenever I have been contacted I\u2019ve tried to be polite and shut down the conversation, recommending therapy, talking to my ex and simply moving on. \n\nBut it\u2019s entirely threw me off and it has enraged me, after two years of peace. I have a new partner (Of four and a half years) and we get married next year, I\u2019ve fully moved on with my life. But this caught me off guard, after the initial shock wore off I find myself furious that this person feels entitled to dip into my life whenever they feel like it and search for something I can\u2019t provide. I do feel sorry if she still finds this difficult, but is that not the cross you carry for the actions you took? \n\nI always try to be a kind person, but I\u2019m struggling to decide the correct course of action here, and thought some thoughts from strangers on the internet wouldn\u2019t hurt! If nothing else writing it all down has helped somewhat! Am I right to feel enraged by this, a big part of me wants to reply, the polite responses have previous failed and a part of me wants to respond having switched the dial to B\\*tch level: Expert. But I\u2019m totally conflicted! \n\nAnyway if you made it this far thanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2080563, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ex\u2019s GF will not quit pestering me", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570269090, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd572d/exs_gf_will_not_quit_pestering_me/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wooweel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_j6wx2ag", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570176929, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd4fpr/boyfriend_24m_confessed_that_he_cheated_on_me_23f/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dd4fpr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 230, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd4fpr/boyfriend_24m_confessed_that_he_cheated_on_me_23f/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570176929, "score": 533, "selftext": "Long time lurker here. So my boyfriend of 8 years suddenly confessed that he was actually cheating on me with one of his co-workers. He explained that he was confessing because he wanted things to end with his #2. He admitted that they slept together and that it happened more than once. Honestly, I think the reason why he suddenly confessed is because the #2's ex-boyfriend/baby daddy hacked into the girl's phone and was able to retrieve all the conversations and was also able to take screenshots. Screenshots showed that they were exchanging \"I love you's\", and the girl's baby daddy was threatening to expose both of them. This has all been going on a while, as my boyfriend explained it has been going on for more than 2 months. My boyfriend showed remorse and utter regret, but I'm just so numb right now, that I don't even know how to behave myself. It just feels so fast and so on the nose. My boyfriend cried for hours explaining the he just wanted a chance to redeem himself and save our relationship. He promised to change for the better and make drastic improvements on our relationship too, but i don't wanna fall for this s**t all over again. This is the first time he's cheated on me, but the magnitude is just beyond me. The #2's baby daddy messaged me saying that my boyfriend and his \"wife\" was having an affair. He was pleased to hear that we broke up, as he felt it was justice for him. The girl my boyfriend has been cheating on me with had the audacity to message me on facebook and tell me that we needed to talk. She literally just said sorry, but in like 4 sentences, the gist, she was sorry. Now, my dilemma is this, my boyfriend is pushing me to stay with him and give him a single chance, that's it, but this seems way too much for me right now, so what do you think I should do? I'm currently taking my masters and still have a lot of papers to complete before the semester ends, this month. \n\nTldr; boyfriend had sex with his coworker more than once and begging me for another chance.

It's a very small company but as I live in a third world country, work is really hard to find. I do not have the opportunity to grow as the supply for jobs is much higher than the demand. My wife is a house maker and we have been married 8 years. As I said its a third world country so health care or health insurance isn't something we are provided by the company I work for. \n\nWe were first blessed with a kid in the year 2015 but due to some complications my wife had a miscarriage. We cried every day but we couldn't do much about it. \n\nWe were blessed with an another baby daughter in the year 2017 and she is an angel. We have had so many happy moments. My baby is the most precious thing that I have in life. She had always been a skinny kid and we didn't think much of it. We thought its just her physical appearance. She had been constantly falling sick but that is where we were wrong. We thought that kids fall sick all the time. \n\nA week ago we discovered that our daughter has leukemia. \n22 days ago my baby all of a sudden started swelling. Her stomach was all bloated and we didn't understand what to do about it so we took her to a doctor. Her lymph nodes were all swollen up. \n\nWe couldn't understand what was going on, I did know that lymph nodes are swollen if someone has cancer but no parent on earth would even wish to imagine something so horrible for their kid. She was breathing heavy. My poor baby. \n\nWe went to the doctor. The doctor adviced us for have a few tests. I was there with my kid. It was so horrible to watch. My baby. My poor baby. I wish that she would get all my life. I would trade her life for mine without thinking much. But that is not how it works. \n\nYesterday I went to the governments office to seek help but they told me it takes time. My baby doesn't have that.\n\nWe talked to the doctors and they advised us that we need to go through a lot of procedures that will make our daughter live. The problem here that we have is it's extremely expensive. The savings we have isn't enough for our daughter and I feel like I have failed as a father.\n\nMy wife is blaming me if we loose our daughter, it's on me. As I have been the provider for our house.

She has a son from a previous relationship, who I've not only met but was fond of. I wouldn't say step dad material by any means, but we had a little friendship going. The dad's in and out of prison and the kid's life, so I'm the only guy like that he's had in his life that fulfills any real decent male role model figure. Me and her were even talking about living together too. \n\nA few weeks ago, I get a visit from the police and they arrest me for sexually assaulting her son! I'd been bailed on condition I wouldn't go near them, and as a result I'd been placed on \"gardening leave\" at work. \n\nLast week, I got a letter saying the case had been dropped and I don't any longer have to attend my next bail hearing. That was it. I rang the policeman in charge of the investigation, and at the time he said he couldn't comment too much as there was still an active investigation but basically her son confessed he had made it up and I'm innocent!\n\nTo say I was mad/shocked/confused was an understatement. Basically a couple of days later, I'd had one drink too much and rang her to confront her. She answered, all apologetic and explained that this little fucking nephew of hers (12m - I've always hated this kid when I've met him, he's so disrespectful and always getting into trouble at school and into fights etc) did it to her son at this party they went to a few days before I was arrested and when her son confessed someone had touched him, he panicked and said it was me instead of his cousin. I guess him being questioned by the police scared him so he had told the truth. \n\nI was so disgusted and just hung up on her, deleted my social media too so I don't have to have anything to do with them. \n\nShe's been ringing me since, texting me, emailing me and is collectively saying even though she's so sorry that she put me through all this, she can't be too sorry as are wanted to protect her son but she really wants us to get back to where we were again and her son misses me too and has been crying saying he's hurt me. She said this can make us stronger and we can have a good future. I've not answered at all, I've got nothing to say. I'm thinking of ghosting her. \n\nI can't lie and say I don't have love for her or her son, but if I'm honest I'm way too hurt. I'd always know she once thought I did something so unspeakable to her son, and I'll also never be able to forget that his lies (no Matter the reason) could have wrecked my life. And I'd never want the risk of running into her nephew again, I never ever want anything to do with him again. \n\nWhat should I do Reddit?\n\nTldr was accused of sexually assaulting girlfriends son, he admitted I didn't do it and now she had apologised and wants to get back together.

This will probably be long because there are a lot of details to it that I don't want to leave out so that people can see this from my perspective before they tell me what they think.\n\nSo the backstory, my wife has a younger brother. Supposedly (I'll explain) they're not blood related. From what she's told me, they are both from donor sperm and eggs because her parents couldn't have children. They don't look anything like their parents so that checks out. But to me, and to everyone else (I know because my wife has even mentioned it) they look very similar. Like maybe the same sperm/egg donor was used for both of them. You hear of doctors using their own sperm and that kind of thing, and I just don't think that two totally unrelated people would look almost like twins but anyway, not that it matters in all of this, maybe it does, but they're supposedly not related by blood. She has also told me that they used to 'mess about' as children and 'do things' with one another, alluding to sexual experimenting. I'm an only child so I have no idea if this is normal, I googled a bit and it seems like kids can do these things and grow up fine so I don't know. I'm including it in case it matters.\n\nMy wife and I have been trying to have a baby for going on three years now with no success whatsoever. We haven't had any kind of intervention to figure out which one of us it is but we suspect it's me because I was married previously when I was younger and we couldn't have kids either, but now my ex has a couple of kids with her new husband so there's that. I'm including this because it could be part of the motivation if she did what I suspect, but hope that she did not do.\n\nThe night in question was awhile back, like a week or so, it's just taken me this long to get to the point where I just feel like I need some kind of input from outside. I had gone out with some friends and my wife told me she was going to have friends over to the house while I was gone. This is normal, we do this kind of thing often. But one of my friends never showed and the other one had to be home earlier than usual so I went back home sooner than I expected to, and this is what I find: I walk in and my wife rushes out of the bathroom. She acts very shocked to see me and sort of guilty. She just seemed to be acting weirdly to me, overly animated and alert, like something was wrong. She was a little buzzed but not drunk. There didn't seem to be anyone else there, so we started talking, and then we hear a sound from the bedroom of somebody puking. We both ran in there and here is her brother absolutely plastered, throwing up in our bed. We are all casual drinkers but I've never seen him like this before and I've known him for longer than I've known my wife (I actually met her through him, I teach at the university he attends). I grabbed him and rushed him into the bathroom and put him in the tub on his side and the whole time he was going \"I'm sorry mate, please don't kill me, she made me do it, I told her you'd kill me\" and that sort of thing, just slurring and babbling like that, and at first I was thinking he's so drunk he thinks I'm someone else. Also, I noticed that his jeans were unbuttoned and unzipped. I was mainly concerned with getting the continuous puke fountain out of my bed so I didn't mention it at the time. So then we go to strip the bed and put new sheets on, etc. and I noticed that on the side he was on there were some wet splotches near where his ass was. I saw it and I sort of thought, hmm. Odd. What was he doing? Wanking in our bed? And maybe he was, I have no idea. It was just not something I'd expect of him, he's a decent young guy and generally very respectful. But again he was completely trashed so I don't know.\n\nI asked my wife why he was so drunk and she said she didn't know; she thought he was having some issues with a girl he liked and maybe he wanted to forget about them. Meanwhile she ran and stuffed the sheets into the washer immediately, which on one hand was understandable because of the puke but on the other hand, I know her and she's not usually so keen to jump on things like that when she's having a drink and relaxing. I think ordinarily she would have waited until the next morning. She seemed to not want to talk about him at all, went and poured us both some wine, and sat at the table. What was odd to me was that she almost seemed not to want to deal with her brother at all, or she seemed to want to pretend he wasn't there, when usually I think, from experience, she'd be hovering over him if he was in a condition like that. I went to check on him repeatedly because I could hear him throwing up and I wanted to make sure he wasn't choking on it or anything but she would hang back and didn't seem to want to engage with him at all. She kept offering me drinks even after I said I was done, which is also unlike her, and even wanted to have sex with me while her brother was in the attached bathroom puking intermittently and mumbling. I wasn't really in the mood so we didn't but now I wish we had so I could have sort of checked to see if there was anything already there if you know what I mean.\n\nThe next morning her brother didn't seem to remember any of it; we both made sure he was alright and gave him some pain medication and ice water with breakfast and he asked a few times what had happened, said he couldn't remember, and apologized for getting so drunk. He seemed embarrassed, and hung over, but not guilty in any way. But my wife was still acting weird imo, there was just this very strange vibe I was getting from her that she was not telling me something. She was kind of overly talkative and nervous and that's just not how she usually is. She seemed to really want to get her brother out of there, and drove him home while I was in the shower without even saying anything to me.\n\nSo obviously this isn't a cut and dried sort of situation. I'm not ordinarily a jealous/suspicious type of guy. I cannot point blank ask her if she fucked her own brother. This isn't the sort of thing you can just ask someone. And there's a good chance I might be wrong, but my gut is telling me something weird happened that night. Am I insane and just imagining that this was very odd? Right now I keep thinking if she turns up pregnant this month I will die inside. I will not know what to do. I love her, she's way too beautiful for me, and we get along so well. I don't want to lose her which is why I haven't said anything even though it's killing me. I feel like I'm living in some kind of surreal, fucked up film or something.

Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.\n\nMy father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.\n\nAfter all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.\n\nAfter a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.\n\nWe got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.\n\nIn the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.\n\nNeither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.\n\nMy parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.\n\nI won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.\n\nI am not interested in their life's or families or anything.\n\nMom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.\n\nDad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.\n\nAs far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.\n\nAnyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now.

I told her we could move on whatever pace she wanted, and that I will do everything to support her. Aaaand after that I told her I'm a virgin. She was surprised, but also sort of suspected it seeing as I never initiated anything sexual.. But she laughed it off! And she told me not to worry about it, that we can make this work together. She was glad I told her, and very happy that she told me about her past because it was a huge burden for her.\n\nWell we did take things slow. She said she felt extremely comfortable around me, ngl that made me feel pretty good. Everything went well! Still got a lot to learn..

I\u2019m not a native speaker and in a bad situation right now.\n\nMy(27f) boyfriend(36m) and I have been together for nearly 3 years. I officially moved in to his place after 6 months of dating. His job requires lots of business trips which can last for months so we\u2019re in a long distance relationship half of the time. We text almost everyday and video call sometimes. Everything was going great. \n\nYesterday when cleaning up, I found out that he had a hidden wifi camera with night vision in the bedroom pointing straight at our bed. It was hidden among cables and other electronic devices (TV, Xbox, hard drive...) and we have a cleaning lady coming often so I was oblivious to it for a long time. He\u2019s in another country now. I unplugged the camera and checked the SD card (32Gb). There was some videos of me changing clothes, singing, doing crazy things and sometimes sleeping naked. It\u2019s the type of camera that you can watch live feed on your phone. I feel like my privacy is invaded and want to move out immediately but the problem is I can\u2019t confront him because he\u2019s having a difficult time at work and I don\u2019t want to make it worse for him. I don\u2019t know what to do. I love him so much and we already have a long term plan but this is a serious breach of trust. He lied to me about an important detail in his background when we first met. I discovered the truth months ago but forgave him because I cared for him deeply and really wanted to make him happy. He said he was cheated on more than one time so I wonder if it was the reason why he set up a camera.  He also jokingly asked about having a sex tape a while ago but I just dismissed it. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do anything stupid when I\u2019m angry, depressed and confused so I\u2019m here to ask: \na) Should I ignore all his work related issues and talk to him about it now or just wait until things get better and bring it up?\nb) Should I leave him? It would break my heart but I don\u2019t want any more lies or secrets from him. Fool me once...\nc) How are the videos and pictures stored?

My father's idea of parenting was to hit you for everything. Ask you to do your homework? Punch to the arm. Needs you to take out the trash? Slap to the head. He hit me so hard in my mouth that a part of my lip will be permanently numb. You only had to worry about my father's violence when he was in the early part of the day's drinking. His favorite was Allen's Brandy and Bud. My mother never really protected us from him and really actually made things worse for us. At 17 I moved out and by 21 my father was dead. My mother and I were not in communication. My mother is her own version of toxic. We got back in touch when I was 22 and were in contact for just over two years until I ended it again at 25. My mother blamed her kids for our father's behavior in an attempt to try and explain why she never left or protected us. It was all a \"big misunderstanding\". My father was also sexually very inappropriate and her excuse was that we slept in pajamas. Just before I got married, I met my mom one last time to talk to her and laid everything on the line and she instead just tried to beat me up with it. I told her we were done and walked out the door. My sisters also cut her off.\n\nMy husband and I met when I was 23 and right away, I wasn't sure how I landed a guy like him. I dated absolute losers/thugs because I thought it would \"protect\" me from my father (thank you, therapy!). My now husband asked me to marry him and I said yes. He has a normal, healthy and \"together\" family. He has goals and dreams and ambitions, with an education. He doesn't really drink and doesn't throw fists. When he asked, I saw it as a way to get away from my past and immediately said yes. I insisted on a very short engagement because I wanted to lock-down the marriage and we got married 4 years ago. I will admit that I wasn't *in love* with him when we got married. I was escaping a bad family situation and didn't really understand healthy relationship dynamics. I learned to love him rather quickly, I understood how he felt and after a year, knew that I felt exactly the same way. We've had a wonderful, happy marriage so far. We have fun together, have a great sex life and are so open with one another. One secret I kept was that I didn't ever want him knowing that when we got married I didn't love him. I figured that would only hurt him and that never, ever came out. Maybe that was a mistake. \n\nLast night I was having my last therapy session and my husband joined-in. We were talking about how much things have changed and how our relationship has progressed when the therapist quipped something like \"you even fell in love with him!\" which triggered my husband to follow-up. I must have looked like death warmed over because he realized what she meant. She followed-up with: \"but, she... loves you, uh, now?\" Like, WTF. And with that, our time was up. I had never seen such a huge amount of hurt. He just sort of dragged himself into the car and then dragged himself to bed. This morning he said he understood, but looked rotten. I told him I absolutely do love him and the therapist just misspoke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do in this situation.

Her oldest (10) doesn't have his biological father around and lives with us full time. Her youngest (6) has a 50/50 schedule with the biological father. This has on occasion cause strain on the relationship as the bio father often makes decisions with his new wife in relation to the 6 year old without my partners consent. These decisions are often for the convenience of himself like where the kid goes to school. We actually bought a house next to a school (literally backyard is touching the playground) so mornings would be easier but instead of walking just outside to go to school we are still driving him a mile away so he can go to the school next to the bio father's house.\n\nI've tried to push back but my partner does not like conflict and will complain about the decisions the biological father makes but never do anything about it. Her go-to is that she's playing the long game and will eventually get her way, and that she'll kill them with kindness. After 5 years it's becoming obvious that this will not happen. They call the shots, we're along got the ride.\n\nEarlier this week when my partner picked up her (our) son from school he was having a fit. When they got home he was still in a sour mood so I took him to the playground and noticed he had a large black box under his shirt tied to his neck. I asked him about it and he said he didn't know what it was but if he wore it he would get \"points\". The reason I hadn't seen it before is because my partner would remove the device at pickup and never told me about it. This rang huge alarm bells for me because it was clearly some sort of tracking device.\n\nI did my research, found the white papers, found the patents, and discovered that it in fact is a tracking device. It not only is capable of tracking location but it also listens for audio cues to determine what media (tv, radio, music) is being consumed. This data is associated with the name, age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, and potentially other personally identifiable information, to the wearer. The program is disguised as a \"survey\" but reading the marketing materials and investor relations material it's clearly for data mining and sale to marketing companies. The biological father gets $45/mo for this, and is entered into a lottery to receive a bonus. The points the individual gets relates to how much useful data they've collected but I don't know if this translates to higher payouts.\n\nSo to put things bluntly. My 6 year old is being made to wear a tracking device that monitors his media consumption and location, is personally identifiable to him, and is sold to marketers.\n\nAfter learning this I tried to explain it to my son. He was confused and forgot everything I said after a day. To be fair how is a 6 year old going to understand this. Location tracking? Audio cues? Media consumption? What is marketing? What is PII? But what's clear to me is that he cannot reasonably consent to this. I wouldn't recommend adults participate in this program, let alone children.\n\nI was upset and when the children were down for bed I brought it up with my partner. She first accused me of being neglegent for taking this long to notice- later admitting that she was ensuring I wouldn't see it by hiding it. She then told me it wasn't a problem because she posts pictures of them on Instagram already (which if that sounds like a reasonable argument it's important to remember that that data is personally identifiable to her and doesn't invite marketers into her children's lives). After some back and forth and argument on consent, ethics, the dangers of marketing (full disclosure I work with adtech and know how this data can be used to manipulate adults) we ended the conversation with no real progress other than making our feelings known.\n\nIn the end. She defended her ex and wasn't going to help me get rid of this leech on our son. So I told the 6 year old he doesn't have to wear the device if he doesn't want to. And if his other parents had a problem with that  they could confront me about it. He was very worried he would lose the points though, so I bought both the kids a step tracker watch to wear so they could accumulate points in the same way by playing. We have a board that shows how many points (steps) they get. And if they get enough points well get ice cream or go out for pancakes or something. Unfortunately I can't do much to stop his other parents from making him wear the tracker, and my partner will not side with me on this issue.\n\nLately it's been the same kill-them-with-kindness routine but with me this time. It's me against the ex, his wife, and my partner. Conversations have been passive aggressive- even going so far as to talk about how much fun she had sexually with her other ex's in front of my family.\n\nI don't want to live like this. But the children are important to me. Their safety is important to me. And while the 6 year old has another father, I'm the only one the 10 year old has. I can't just leave, but I don't know how to live with my partner who is complicit in letting her ex sell our son, fight me, and demoralize me on a daily basis.\n\nHow do I proceed?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2078362, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My partner lets her ex put a tracking device on our 6 year old for cash.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570203942, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcsoyt/my_partner_lets_her_ex_put_a_tracking_device_on/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThrowRAdinero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4pxk5ebf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570117023, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcskoo/i_f_28_walked_in_on_my_step_son_8_touching_my_son/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dcskoo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 323, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcskoo/i_f_28_walked_in_on_my_step_son_8_touching_my_son/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570117023, "score": 11584, "selftext": "I\u2019m so stunned, it hasn\u2019t even sunk in.\n\nIt was early this morning.

This isn\u2019t necessarily a deal breaker for me but I was a little hesitant to continue things with him I can\u2019t lie. I won\u2019t get into the reasons why but I\u2019m sure they are more or less inferred. I\u2019ve recently had a big life transition so I decided to be open to dating someone who wasn\u2019t initially \u201cmy type\u201d as our general vibe was good otherwise and I\u2019m already trying a lot of new paths in life. Anyways, I\u2019ve been single for a few years and was looking for a real relationship not just a hook up. We met on okcupid and nowhere in his profile did it list his occupation or past military experience.\n\nI\u2019m more liberal in general and while I\u2019m\nnot entirely anti gun I\u2019m also not a enthusiast. This becomes relevant later. On our 3rd date he tells me how he has a huge gun collection and that he is responsible for quite a few people\u2019s deaths from his military experience. Asks me if this was a dealbreaker. I was kinda shocked but I guess I somewhat expected that but I also don\u2019t known very many people with prior military experience so it was still a little shocking. \n\nOn our 4th date he tells me he is a cop and simultaneously gets really sexually aggressive with me which was a huge turn off. I wasn\u2019t really interested in taking things to a physical level yet. We had only kissed once or twice on other dates and while I was attracted to him I just wasn\u2019t interested in getting to the sex level so soon. I\u2019m conservative about that or anything just didn\u2019t feel right with him. He\u2019s very physically attractive but there\u2019s something about his personality that wasn\u2019t making me click on that level with him. \n\nOk so now the unfortunate part. After this date where he was practically trying to drag me to his car to take me back to his place I decided I was not interested in another date. Honestly his behavior made me really uneasy and scared me. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of physical violence and abuse in my childhood and red flags were basically falling from the ceiling for me when he did that. \n\nI called him the next day and explained I didn\u2019t think we were compatible and I didn\u2019t want to waste each other\u2019s time since we were both looking for a relationship. He seems to take it well and thanked me for being honest with him. We wished each other the best and I thought that was it. \n\nFor the past two weeks he has been constantly texting and harassing me. When I block his number he somehow gets another one. His texts started by begging me to give him another chance and have escalated to him threatening me if I don\u2019t meet with him. He\u2019s also send me multiple messages that indicate he knows where I am. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but he\u2019s described outfits I\u2019ve worn on particular days and other things that lead me to believe he might be following me. I never told him where I live or work and somehow he seems to know both of these things. I don\u2019t have a social media presence and I don\u2019t have location sharing on my phone so I\u2019m really starting to freak out. \n\nWhen I do respond to texts and confront him he denies it\u2019s him and has this absolutely ridiculous fake stalker persona when it\u2019s CLEARLY HIM. I am so confused and stressed out. \n\nOk so the whole reason I\u2019m writing this post is I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s wise to report him to the police that he works for. Could this backfire for me?\nI feel like it will like they protect their own. I\u2019ve always been distrustful of police based on past experiences I\u2019ve had with them. Does anyone know any other resources I could use besides the police? Am I overreacting? Some days he doesn\u2019t contact me at all and others he sends me 10+ messages.

I read all the comments and they helped sort of.\n\nI would also like to thank all the male survivors who reached out to me. Like sometimes with a \u201csituation\u201d like this it is easy to feel alone because it  is a problem that we never here about ever in the news, school, academia. So in a weird way it is nice to know that there are others out there and that I am not alone. \n\nI guess I\u2019ll answer some questions before I get in to the update. \n\nDid I ever go to the police- No in the country I went to college in there is no such thing as female male rape \n\nPregnancy- nope she was never pregnant or at least she didn\u2019t tell me \n\nNow for the update\n\nI have started going to a therapist to try and get over this issue that I am experiencing and it was hard at first to even go. I almost flaked on my first appointment I was so scared and felt pretty ashamed. \n\nBut I guess this is where the problems start, my plan of thought was to not tell my wife until I was more ready or at least until I had processed it more. \n\nHowever I guess this only makes sense in the context of my job. So I go to work everyday from 8-8 and every night for about a year now I come\nback sometime around 8:30 to 8:45. However in order to go to therapy I needed to take an hour out of my day at around 3 so I had to get home an hour later on therapy days which by chance land on Tuesdays and Fridays very week.\n\nSo after two weeks of this happening and me giving what I think are good excuses to why I am late, I guess she starts snooping around my phone a bit and well I guess she found it weird reddit was on my phone- not a redditer- so she clicks in it and sees notifications from my last post. \n\nSo yah we kind of get in a.... fight??? I guess I don\u2019t even know how to describe it like, she was mad at me for not telling her about this ever. And then she was also crying because she felt so sad this happened and it seemed like she was partially  angry at me for letting this happen. \n\nSo after a heated discussion for a few hour, at this point it is after midnight, she goes to stay with her mother.\n\nAnd it is like seriously women, you just learned my deepest secret ever, something that makes me feel nauseous to think about and you just leave.\n\nLike I don\u2019t know what I wanted her to do to me, like I kind of wanted to be comforted by her but she just left and I slept terribly that night I keep replaying the discussion over and over and again and ughhh.\n\nYa she came back the next day and got stuff from ours, to take back to her parents house and she\u2019s still living there \ud83d\ude41. \n\nSo like I guess that\u2019s the update pretty grim in the grand scheme of things but I thank everyone on reddit for the help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2078217, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE: How do I (m27) tell my wife (f26) that I was raped", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570198861, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcrkap/update_how_do_i_m27_tell_my_wife_f26_that_i_was/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "not_for_clinical_use", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_y7orq8n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570105551, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcq5st/my_41f_wife_just_told_me_42m_that_if_it_wasnt_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dcq5st", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 56, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcq5st/my_41f_wife_just_told_me_42m_that_if_it_wasnt_of/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570105552, "score": 1087, "selftext": "She was diagnose with Multiple Sclerosis at 18yo.

I've only had 3 relationships before my current one with \"John\". My twin sister \"Sarah\" has tried to interfere with all of them. \n\nTwo of my ex's cheated on me with her. The third we broke up for other reasons but Sarah still tried to seduce him. He was a good guy and always had boundaries with her, but that didn't stop her from trying. To the point of sending him nudes multiple times then claiming \"oops wrong person\" when he told her he wasn't interested.\n\nWhen that didn't work she also tried to break us up by lying to my ex and our mutual friends that I was cheating. My ex didn't believe her but some friends did. So yeah that was fun to deal with...\n\nThen, when we were kids like in middle/high school, if Sarah found out I had a crush she went after the guy herself. I used to tell her those things because well, isn't that what sisters do. She always used it against me. I told her I was working up the courage to ask my crush/ the guy I was \"talking to\" to prom. She then asked him and he said yes. She said he'd just been using me to get to her. Another time a few years before that she announced to everyone in a class we shared that I liked this one boy who got bullied a lot. Kids then started teasing him even more and he hated me. I felt horrible for months, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. She also once told a teacher who's class I was doing bad in that I was into him and willing to do \"favors\" for better grades. That got reported and I had to go through this whole counseling thing before it was finally cleared up. It was extremely embarrassing. My sister just blew it off as a prank.\n\nThere's so many other situations like this, she either gets guys who are interested in me to sleep with her or ruins my chances with them by making up bullshit to make me look bad. She's ruined some of my friendships lying about me too (told my best friend in high school I was gossiping meanly about her and went so far as faking text messages.) I don't know if she even actually wants these people for herself. You might think it's obviously jealousy but sometimes I honestly think she just gets a kick out of messing with me.\n\nAnyway I've finally got my life more together after wasting the first couple years of college on being depressed and a gaming addiction. I met my boyfriend \"John\" at a campus organization. I haven't told Sarah, but he ended up meeting my parents by accident today. I don't have much contact with them but they decided to come for a surprise visit... they live over 5 hours away and do this a few times a semester even though I've said I don't like it. But that's for another post. John was in my room with me when they got here. I had no choice but to introduce them (he knows I was holding off on having them meet because I don't have the greatest relationship with them)\n\nSarah lives at home with my parents while going to college locally. I'm certain they're going to mention meeting my boyfriend. And then cue her insisting on coming with them the next time they surprise-visit me. Also stalking my social medias to try to figure out who he is.\n\nI've tried to explain the issues I have with her to my parents. They think I'm over reacting, they say she just wants to know what's going on in my life. To be involved. Yes that is the problem...her involvement. \n\nAnd, not to mention we used to be closer before I lost trust in her to stop doing this shit, so I've seen what her own life is like. She does things my parents have no idea of. She takes party drugs sometimes. This wouldn't be a big deal but she has no idea how to be responsible. She drives people around while drunk and high, my parents think she's with a friend studying on weekends but she's actually clubbing in the city and then crashes with her friends for the night. I'm not sure how many real boyfriends she's had but she's hooked up with a lot of guys the same night she met them. This has meant a few times she was scared of pregnancy. I've had to help her get Plan B. It sometimes feels like she sleeps with nearly any man that smiles at her, and told me she's even had \"sex\" with a few girls while wasted however that's possible... she confides all these things to me, but whenever I need someone to talk to she has no time. Never wants to hear anything unless she can save it as ammo. So I've gradually stopped telling her most things.\n\nIf my parents knew all this they might see where I'm coming from, it's not just random that I don't want her meeting my boyfriend. It's not because I want to hurt her or something. The problem is, our parents are really strict and traditional, and they'd probably kick her out if I told them any of that. They don't believe in sex before marriage. My boyfriend is the first person I've had sex with, and I'm afraid my sister could use that against me to them if she finds out.\n\nSo what do I do? How can I keep Sarah from finding out about him and doing the same thing she's done with all my past boyfriends? How do I explain it to my parents?\n\nTL;DR: my sister has a pattern of interfering with my relationships. She's gotten guys to cheat on me with her. My parents accidentally met him today and will probably tell her.

Their father passed away, so I am the sole parent and caregiver. My child recently started high school, and within a few weeks, told me that they were now a transmale and would like me to call them Marcus. My child told me they prefer gender-neutral pronouns for the time being while they transition, which I have always and continue to respect.\n\nI consider myself a fairly liberal and open minded person. I am bisexual myself, and have a lot of friends in the LGBT+ community. I often go to events, parades, etc. However, I do believe that my child is being heavily influenced by new high school friends and is going through a phase rather than actually being trans. I would like to clarify, though, that despite my thoughts I have *never* expressed them to my child, and have never actively questioned or attacked their identity. I am trying to be supportive, but I am worried that if it is just a phase, they will lock themselves into this for life without actually being happy with their decision later.\n\nI have multiple reasons to have this conclusion. For one, I have asked my child if they ever experienced any form of dysphoria and they have said no. I asked this as soon as they told me, and have asked multiple times since. Every answer is always no, never experienced dysphoria.\n\nIn addition to this, while growing up my child was always extremely feminine. Margret loved horses, sparkles, princesses, barbie dolls, makeup, etc. She had a fairy princess themed bubblegum pink bedroom that she helped design herself. She wanted to be a makeup artist. We would always have spa days on the weekend, paint our nails, do our makeup, and other generally \"girly\" things. Even a few months ago, although my child's interests diversified to things like science and video games as well as the usually \"girl\" things, they still loved most if not all of these things. However, now as Marcus, my child says they hate all of those things and rejects anything that isn't \"for boys\". They used to watch Sailor Moon religiously and now refuse to even talk about the show because it's \"for girls\". Marcus even refuses to use soaps that I buy because they have a \"feminine scent\". I can understand that perhaps more feminine things can be triggering if you have dysphoria, but my child admitted to me many times they do not.\n\nI think this is another issue in itself, and my child is hypocritically gendering interests while preaching that all interests are equal. \"Makeup is for girls I hate it\". I pointed out that plenty of men like makeup and many are even very successful in the industry. I have caught Marcus looking at my makeup often and frequently looks sad when they watch me do my makeup. I can tell he wants to use it, but refuses because \"it's for girls and I'm a boy now\". They have never had any interest is things like sports,  but suddenly want to play soccer because \"the soccer boys look so cool and manly\". Every time I pick them up from practice, they complain about how hard soccer is and they wish they could skip practice. I am worried that my child is forcing this \"masculine\" identity too much. Even when I try to be supportive and say it's okay to be a man and like \"girly\" things that I know they like, Marcus always rejects them. Like they're over compensating to prove they're a boy? \n\nFinally, a group of my child's friends came over after school to study and play video games. Out of the group of 6, 4 of them identified as either trans or non-binary. One of them is an upperclassman transmale who I can see my child obviously idolizes. My child regularly raves about this friend in particular, and for a while I thought it was a crush, which is still might be, but I think it's also just admiration. I think my child might be going through a phase like \"X is so cool I want to be like them\".\n\nMarcus has expressed to me that they want to go on hormones and eventually get surgery. Prior to this, I was always trying to be very respectful and supportive, however this has really made me think and question. I don't want to legitimatize their feelings and identity if they are in fact actually trans. However, I don't want them to go on hormones or get surgery just to fit a phase and regret it later. I'll admit I don't know a lot about how permanent hormones will be, but surgery is a pretty permanent thing. I don't want them to do something to ruin their lives if they realize later that they're not actually trans. I don't want them to drop their \"feminine\" interests in favor of things they don't really like just to fit the image.\n\nAm I being a bad parent here? I have suggested therapy to Marcus, but they are against it for the time being. I think therapy would help to really determine their true feelings and identity, and will continue to suggest it. However, in the interim, is there anything I can do to help Marcus understand where I am coming from without being too dismissive?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2077032, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is my (46F) child (14) going through a trans phase or am I being an unsupportive parent?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570150405, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcjkyd/is_my_46f_child_14_going_through_a_trans_phase_or/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lisenda", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4prdvwtv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570054808, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dchlh0/i_17f_found_my_mothers_37f_suicide_note_and_dont/", "gilded": 1, "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "id": "dchlh0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 100, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dchlh0/i_17f_found_my_mothers_37f_suicide_note_and_dont/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570054809, "score": 716, "selftext": "My father (41M) cheated on my mother for about a year.

It's because the sex in my previous relationship was way better. \" I really didn't know what to reply and we kinda just awkwardly laughed about it for a second. \n\nI've always felt insecure about my erections ever since I tried viagra once and it remained solid hard after I ejaculated so I suggested that I'll try and use viagra next time. She said \"Well it's not just that.. the size too.\" \n\nI think this was the most humiliating moment of my life. I've always felt like my penis was around average size (5 and a half inches) but this completely shattered me. I think I froze for a moment or too and tried downplaying the whole situation despite boiling with rage, humiliation and confusion inside. She said she loved me despite that and it's not that important to her. \n\nI don't know what to think. I really really like the girl but how long can a relationship last with one partner not sexually attracted to the other? How can I trust that she would not look for someone else to satisfy her sexual desires? I was shooting for long term with this girl and now I'm really confused.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2076762, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (23M) girlfriend (22F) just told me she had better sexual experiences with her ex which is why her libido towards me is so low.

We've both had a lot of time to think and we've met everyday to talk, and we're pretty much 100% certain what's going to happen. So she revealed that she wants a relationship and be exclusive with me and asked me to seriously think about it, and that she wanted to know what I wanted before making a decision. And well yeah, I pretty much realized I don't know why we're NOT dating.. Lots of common interests. Always lots of fun together and the same sense of humor. Good chemistry in general. But I honestly thought I was only interesting as a FWB to her, because of our age difference. But apparently (lucky me) not. So I told her I want to be with her too, and after lots of discussion we agreed to go for an abortion.\n\n One thing she said stood out for me. She is serious about us, and wants to make it this work. And starting off with a child this early in the relationship is going to be very tough, so the chance that our relationship will survive is slim, and she doesn't want to take that risk. And she didn't plan on having kids for a few more years, and obviously I feel the same way. So yeah who knows maybe she or I will change our mind but this is the plan for now. Luckily abortion is legal in my country. Thanks for the advice everyone. On one hand I'm ridiculously happy that I'm now officially with her, like I honestly thought that wasn't a possibility.

Or bring ice cream to bed and leave the bowl for me to put in the sink the next day. If I don't pick his stuff up, it stays and becomes a pile of dirty dishes and garbage until I clean it.\n\nMy work week varies on 55-65 hours while he works 60-84 hours, pretty much every other week, he works all 7 days. This week he has been \"getting after me\" about the state of our house, saying that if he has to go to work at 6, I should be up and cleaning the house until I go to work at 8..\n\nWhile I do think I should handle a bit more of the housework since I do work less, I don't think it should all fall on me. This morning is when it all came to a head and he woke me up at 5, yelling about how he didn't have any clean clothes (he did, just not the specific type of socks and pair of Jean's he wanted) and how I 'sit around all day on the weekends' (I work a 40 hour week and then bartend various weeknights and thursday, friday and saturday nights so I sleep saturday and sunday days) and that i could have this whole house spotless with all the time i have. I simply told him that he is just as capable of doing laundry as I am and if he knew he needed these clothes he should have washed them last night since I picked up an extra shift and wasn't even home until 11pm.. so we both blew up at each other and now we are in a huge fight.\n\nI have mentioned hiring someone but he said that is stupid because we don't have kids and I should be able to keep the house clean on my own and he would he embarrassed if I did that and he also doesn't want anyone in his space.\n\nBasically, I know he needs to help, I know I need to give him some slack because he puts in very long hours- but just because he is putting in more hours doesn't mean I'm not working long hours and I might be tired too.. and I don't know how to address this is an calm manner that he will listen to. I need advice on how to calmly talk about this because I get fired up every time I think about it. I've tried telling him that just because he works harder than i do does not mean that I'm not working hard and that i dont deserve to just chill on a day off, but it doesn't seen to matter.

Me and M were very good friends throughout highschool and several years after, until we kind of just stopped talking for a few years.\nAnyway, We began chatting for a short time and she eventually gave me her number and said we should catch up sometime. I agreed and that was that.\n\nWe texted back and fourth for a few days until she suggested we hangout. I agreed and she ended up stopping by that evening. Somewhere in the conversation she asked if i was single and i said yes, and she said \u201cSame\u201d.  Cool. That night we ended up having great sex.\n\n\nThe next day, we hungout again. I agreed and she ended up coming over again. things got frisky again and right before we did the deed, she asked me to ditch the condom because it hurt her vagina or whatever. She told me she had a IUD and assured me she could not get pregnant.\nI stupidly agreed, i trusted her because she was a good friend of mine back then and she doesn\u2019t seem like the type of person who would lie. \n\n\n\n\nNow this is where it kind of gets NSFW but i\u2019m putting it in the context so it will make more sense in the end. Right before the end of the deed, i mentioned i was about to finish. She told me to finish inside so it doesn\u2019t get all over her. so me being a complete dumbass, did.\n\n\n\nLong story short, for the next two weeks give or take, M came to my house pretty much every night, and in those two weeks I probably finished inside her 30+ times.\n\n\n\nThen one day she pretty much just went ghost. She would only text me once or twice a day, and was being very short, she said something along the lines of she didn\u2019t want to catch feelings then eventually she just completely went ghost. I kind of was like whatever and moved on. \n\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I hadn\u2019t talked to her or seen her in about a year, and last night i went on Facebook for the first time in probably two years to check the marketplace for vehicles. I was scrolling through my feed just seeing what my old friends were up to when i seen a picture of her holding up a baby. I was shocked and clicked on her profile and sure enough shes married, and has been married to this guy for over 3 years now. All over her profile was pictures of her and her husband and her baby.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point i did some digging and came across a picture she posted in late October of last year of a positive pregnancy test and her husband kissing her stomach, that had the caption \u201cafter over a year of trying, it finally happened, me and (husband name) are so excited for what the future holds\u201d that she had announced on her Facebook.\n\n\nI decided to check my phone and see if i still had our messages to check the dates, but i had deleted them so i came up with the idea to see if me and M had taken any pictures around the time we were having sex and sure enough i found a snapchat i had taken of us drinking and it was dated September 28th of last year. well thats just fantastic. I kind of had a mini heart attack. These dates are way too close for my comfort.\n\n\nTo make matters worse the kid looks pretty similar to me, has my eye color and not the husbands. same hair color, same nose. doesn\u2019t even really look like him. I don\u2019t even know what to do at this point.\n\n\nI barely slept last night and i feel terrible and incredibly stupid even though i had no clue she was married at the time. I haven\u2019t told a soul about this besides posting on here.\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure if i should reach out to the guy and tell him she cheated on him let alone mention that the baby might not be his. I feel for the guy because ive been cheated on before it and fucking sucks. \n\n\nTo make matters even worse, i now have a amazing girlfriend that i have been with for 6 months now, and i dont want to ruin it with her. \n\n\nSo reddit, this is why i have came here to ask you, WHAT should i do?

I\u2019m on mobile and idk how to link it but it\u2019s on my page. \n\nI got a lot of great advice on how to bring up my wanting to pay for treatment to my boyfriend. I have to say I was really nervous for some reason and couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what to say. A few nights ago I was with him and we were talking about his diagnosis. He was really down and worried about his mom. And I just took his face in my hands and told him that I could help, that I wanted to pay and I had the money. He was confused at first and didn\u2019t believe that I had all that so I showed him my bank statement. That was uncomfortable as fuck because as I said before I was raised to never talk about the wealth I was lucky enough to be born into. But I showed him and said that I knew this is what I wanted to do with my savings. \n\nTurns out, life is not that easy and you can\u2019t just pay for a treatment and have that be that. There are checkups, hospital stay costs, etc. Oh and by the way, a lot of you guys mentioned insurance and medicaid and whatnot, it turns out his family is not eligible for a lot of programs because of some really complicated family history involving his father. Honestly I don\u2019t know the details and it\u2019s extremely personal to him so I\u2019m not going to get into it here. They are on the best program that is available to them but it doesn\u2019t cover even close to everything. But anyways, the total cost of everything (assuming there are literal 0 complications and he doesn\u2019t catch any sicknesses during his recovery which he likely will because immune system) is more than I thought. But I still wanted to pay for the treatment at least which is the bulk of it. I told him I wasn\u2019t doing this for our relationship but moreso for him and his mom. And his little brothers who are the cutest and funniest things on the planet.\n\nHe told me no at first but after much discussion he finally accepted my offer. I was really relieved and happy that he did. His mom called me the next day and expressed her gratitude, I love that woman she did so much to make my boyfriend who he is and it just felt right that I was able to help. \n\nThe last few days have actually been good. My boyfriend and I both have had struggled with anxiety and depression and after the initial news that he has cancer we both crashed for a few days and nothing felt real or right. But now we are both looking at the future more positively, this treatment has a really high success rate and no one has to stress about the cost of it. The next few months are going to be really hard. He\u2019s leaving school to receive his first round of treatment soon and he\u2019s too far for me to realistically visit him more than once while still keeping my grades up. I have literally no idea what I\u2019m going to do without him and it\u2019s going to suck not being there if he needs me. And of corse there\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s going to be in increasingly more pain for a while. I\u2019m worried sick about him and I\u2019m just praying to a god I really don\u2019t believe in that everything goes as smooth as possible. \n\nBut with this fear comes a new appreciation for him. I\u2019ve never loved before him and my parents while obviously quite generous with their money, never actually made me feel like I was worth a lot. But he makes me feel like I\u2019m worth everything. There\u2019s a certain beauty in the fact that I can feel his pain and he can feel mine. And I feel blessed that I can still kiss and hug and be with him for the time being. My boyfriend said that the doctors keep telling him to take it one day at a time so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as well. And right now on this day I have someone I love more than anything who loves me back and I don\u2019t know what to feel other than grateful even though the road ahead will be rocky. \n\nAnyways,  I\u2019m sure no one came for the sappy stuff lol. I\u2019m glad he accepted the money I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d want to do with it more than help him. If anyone has had a loved one go through cancer and has advice on how to deal with it I would really appreciate it.

I somehow took that breakup especially hard since things seemed to be going so well. What was especially upsetting is that the breakup followed a discussion about our sexual past, where (upon his request), I revealed that my number was 37. As soon as I told him that I could kind of see his expression change. Things seemed normal for a bit, but he said he wanted to take a days off to think and then just sent me a text... and it was over. \n\nThis event really triggered my insecurities since I've had this happen to be me a few times before recently. It's getting to the point where I am seriously bummed out about the fact that the kind of guys I'm interested in generally seem put off by my history to the point that they just don't want to be in a relationship. \n\nTruth be told, I am not entirely happy with my history either. In college I had a bad relationship, was super busy and a bit depressed and went through this party/hookup phase for years. Initially I found it kind of fun and liberating, and I don't regret all of it. But closer to graduating it felt increasingly empty like it was just the same non-sense on a loop, same lines on Tinder, etc. I also frankly started to just feel used and disrespected my many guys who apparently saw me as an easy target, like I was this stupid girl they could just manipulate to get what they wanted and then be disposed of.\n\nAnyway, since then I have jumped headfirst into my career and became a bit of a workaholic. I am making a nice life for myself and wanted to share it with someone, but I feel like the past is this barrier that keeps coming up. I just feel really shitty about the situation. I have never done *anything* unethical in previous relationships, in fact I have tried to work extra hard to prove that I am loyal, caring, and can be a good partner. But I feel like my history is almost like a brand that people use to pigeonhole me and then that's that. Well, sorry, I can't change what I did, I can only work on who I am now.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just wanted to get it off my chest.

I am a homebody with no real drive to do anything or go anywhere (other than work). She is an adventurer and loves to travel out of country and try new things. We are also different culturally as I am a southern white boy and she is Vietnamese (been in the states most of her life).Finally we are also different mentally: I am normally a logical, deliberate person and she is borderline bi-polar with fits of rage and depression from time to time. We live in the southeastern US.\n\n**Our situation**: She told me this week that she is having urges to cheat on me. She wanted to talk about options for how we can proceed and still be together while fulfilling her other desires. For example the idea of a throuple (another guy) or a V relationship where she can go have sex with this other dude whenever but still come home to me, etc. This discussion did not take me by surprise as she has been very open with her feelings over the years and I know i was not able to meet all of her needs. The reality of this all really hit me this week and I told her I am not comfortable with it. I don't want to be some chump sitting around the house while his wife is out getting busy. She suggested we take a week of separation to see how we feel about each other afterwards. She will be heading to a hotel tonight. While I love her I know this relationship has been difficult for me and seems to be a constant drain on my mental state. She requires a lot of validation and reassurance which I am not very good at delivering.

She is having serious anxiety about leaving her condo to the point where she has broken down in tears several times.\n\nShe has 2 mains issues:\n\n1. Basically she is just stating she is going to miss the condo so much and it was her first home, she designed the closet, chose the blinds, finishes etc and is her \"Dream condo\". She has heavy attachment to the beach/neighborhood as well. \n2. Even though she loves my house she feels like it will never truly be her home and she will always feel like a visitor as long as we live there. She doesn't want to start our marriage like that. \n\nAs a compromise, I said to her that in a year or two if you are truly unhappy we can look into buying a new home  so that it \"feels like ours\" and we can buy in the city she loves. Part of me wants to do that now, but because we have a wedding to pay for and Fall season is a very busy time for my work - it just isn't the right time to pull that off.\n\n**What should I do here to make her feel better and resolve this? Part of me is thinking - do I sell my house and cram myself into her condo? That feels like the wrong move though as we would have no alone time as the condo is literally one small kitchen/living room and a bedroom.

Also, this is a lot of teenager bullshit so skip this post if you don\u2019t wanna deal.\n\n\nThe first relationship was with a guy I\u2019ll call Evan. Evan and I had been good friends for a couple years when one night he admitted he liked me. I like him as well and things were going well for a couple of months until one day, out of the blue, he told me that he couldn\u2019t trust me because I was talking shit about him behind his back. I later found out that lily texted him, telling him that I was talking about him behind his back to her and other people, which wasn\u2019t true at all. I had barely talked to her in 2 months. Evan and I had a huge fallout and didn\u2019t speak for a year. I 100% believe Evan should have talked to me first before blowing up but lily instigated a fight that shouldn\u2019t have existed.\n\nThe second example is with another good friend who I\u2019ll call Nathan. Lily always had a thing for Nathan, but he never reciprocated her feelings. Nathan got into a relationship with a girl named Ariel. Lily would constantly bitch to me about Ariel, saying she wasn\u2019t good enough for Nathan and she was annoying, etc etc. I didn\u2019t personally know Ariel so I just listened. Lily would go to Nathan and tell him that everything she said about Ariel, I said. She also told Ariel and everyone on the track team that I hated Ariel and her friends and thought she was a bitch. Ariel and about 20 other people avoided me for the remainder of the school year.\n\n\nFats forward to now. I am really really good friends with Ariel and her friends from last year. They told me everything lily said I said about them and how they were scared of me/thought I hated them/and were confused when I was friendly to them. Lily almost wrecked our friendship because of what she said. I just don\u2019t know how she can act so sweet and supportive to my face but then make up these lies about me behind my back. We have been friends for 17 years and I would hate to cut her off, I think she\u2019s just going through something. What do you think I should do?

I don't usually drink and i had two beers and two glasses of wine,  and i am definitely \"in my feelings\" right now. \n\nIm approaching 30 and am starting to realize a lot about myself (I'm in nursing school and had to write my own obituary and life story for a psychology class,  and i think it affected me more than it shoukd have) ,  and am starting to confront some uncomfortable realizations.  One of them is that my idea of romance and dating is completely inappropriate and unhealthy.  Let me explain.  \n\nEveryone has some demons in their past and i am no exception.  I grew up in an abusive household,  my dad left,  i was molested by my cousin and youth pastor, was kicked out in my teens for stupid reasons (not putting the dishes away correctly.  My mom is borderline and bi polar). Until i was in my mid 20s, this is what i thought normal was.  I was afraid of everything. I didn't have a relationship until i was 23, and he was an addict.  Actually,  every guy I've dated has had a substance abuse issue.  My need to nurture translates to feelings of love,  and I've been taken advantage of a lot.\n\nI don't trust myself so i don't date anymore.  It's been two years since I've seen a guy or have had sex since the last situation was really unhealthy and im scared.  I also have a hard time being attracted to someone unless i feel the need to nurture.  \n\nI've settled on developing crushes on guys that i have no chance with... married guys,  guys that are way better and more successful than i am.  I develop these fantasies of them being interested in me and taking me on dates.  I would never act on it and they would never know,  it's just something to satisfy the need of being desired.  \n\nIt's fun and harmless until i realise they'll never be into me, thst if they were its because they're looking for a sex object or because they're looking for a side piece.  I end up hurting my own feelings and breaking my own heart over situations that don't actually exist.  \n\nIt's pathetic and stupid.  Im not unattractive and i could date if i wanted to... but i have a lot of insecurities and i feel like i can't.  When writing the obituary assignment,  i realised that i don't want to live a life alone... but i don't know how to fix this. \n\nTL;DR I put myself down in my imaginary relationships with people who would never be interested in me and it's making me sad.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2074741, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (29f) get caught up in imaginary situations with crushes, and then get hurt by the fact that they'll never happen.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570064489, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dc3081/i_29f_get_caught_up_in_imaginary_situations_with/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tiko123321", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yeym3vd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569973939, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dc256p/update_final_update_girlfriend_25f_fall_asleep_at/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dc256p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 64, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dc256p/update_final_update_girlfriend_25f_fall_asleep_at/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1569973940, "score": 192, "selftext": "\n\nOriginal post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbsxjm/update_girlfriend_25f_fall_asleep_at_guyfriend/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nThanks everyone for the reply\u2019s.

Girlfriend I\u2019ve been dating for 2 years since college broke up with me last week and I\u2019m kind of depressed. \n\nGirlfriend is South Asian and her parents are really against us dating but it happened anyway. We were honestly amazing fits for each other\u2014 I was able to help her out with her uncontrollable OCD and helped her get some treatment. She was there for me during my difficult moments in life like when I fucked up my MCAT initially and we were strong until a few days ago. We were honestly convinced we\u2019d stay together throughout med school and even couple\u2019s match but all of a sudden her parents found a personalized birthday gift I got her and started going bezerk on her ass. When I say \u201cbezerk,\u201d I mean absolutely nuts. Her dad used to hit her as a child when she\u2019d come back home with bad grades and even hits her mom now\u2014 I honestly feel like she has Stockholm syndrome from living in that hell hole for so long. Her dad\u2019s truly a narcissistic ass who wants things his way and literally controls every aspect of her life (ruined her friendships, forced her to study in order to get into medical school, and even emotionally abused her by constantly calling her face ugly/openly calling her sister far prettier than she is). Anyway, long story short her parents put my gf through emotional blackmail and then called my parents to say we\u2019re dating and my parents didn\u2019t really give a shit. We pretended to break up over text that day in order to appease her parents BUT the next day her mom started doing even more insane things. She literally called her during lunch at medical school to say how \u201cembarrassed\u201d she was to be her mother and later that day she forced her into getting a \u201cvirginity test.\u201d Her mom literally drove her to a local ER only to hear that virginity tests are something done in the Third World smh...\n\nThat day, she moved in with me after her dad literally kicked her out of the house and we\u2019d been together for 2 weeks, but all of a sudden her abusive dad calls begging for forgiveness and my girlfriend (at the time) literally pulled a full 180\u00b0 and switched her outlook from \u201cI\u2019m never going back home\u201d to \u201cI miss my parents and am willing to break up with you to appease them.\u201d Apparently she\u2019d been thinking about it for a few days when she dropped the news on me a week ago (literally before a major exam) and I was pretty devastated. She told me she\u2019s moving out to be with her parents and can\u2019t stand to hear that her dad is smoking again and her siblings\u2019 grades are apparently suffering since her dad is too sad to be a Tiger dad anymore, and I told her she\u2019s entering a never-ending cycle of getting into fights with her parents (which happens really often) and that this isn\u2019t great at all for her mental health. Anyway, she hasn't been showing any emotion toward this situation at all, says she doesn't want to speak with me since she's \"read articles about how there's no such a thing as a soul mate,\" and I'm honestly over here confused and sad. \n\nMy grades haven\u2019t been the best this semester and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of all the attention I\u2019ve been giving her and stress I\u2019ve had because of her. I honestly feel really bad for her and she says she wants to stay \u201cbest friends,\u201d but I don\u2019t think I have the emotional capacity to stay friends with her knowing we\u2019ll never really be together. \n\nSorry for the long post but should I just forget about her and move on with my life? I guess I\u2019m attached to her and this break up hurts a lot because it\u2019s such a fresh wound but I also want to do well in life and not be constantly drained by her. I\u2019m honestly looking for any advice you could offer, especially if you\u2019ve been through something like this. How can I get out of this hole of hopelessness and constantly missing her?

While looking at google timeline I noticed the Monday after we had the big fight it showed her timeline going to her exes house. It even showed that she typed the address into google for directions. When I asked her about it she said she never went there and didn\u2019t even know where he lived. It wasn\u2019t until I showed her the google timeline she actually admitted to driving by because\u201d she was curious to where he lived.\u201d The raw data points even show her arriving at a certain time and then leaving about 1:30 hours later. She is denying it all and says that the timeline is not accurate because she just drove around the entire time. My question is how accurate are the google data points?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2074283, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So my girlfriend and I recently hit a snag in our relationship a couple weekends ago.

It has gotten so much worse for sure the past few weeks. So we've been together for half a year. This is by far the best relationship I've been in and there's nobody else I want besides her. Things were all good until she found out about my ex girlfriend. We were high school sweethearts, but we got into an accident and things weren't the same after that, and we broke up soon after. This was one year ago. Ever since my now gf found out about her, she started asking questions about her and our relationship. I made the mistake of answering them thinking it was innocent. And now it has gotten to the point where she insists I don't love her like I used to love my ex. That my ex is way prettier. That my ex was a better lay. Basically she is constantly comparing herself to my ex. My ex gf does modeling and I suppose is more conventionally attractive. But in my eyes my gf is just as beautiful if not even more. She even added her on social media and tried to talk to her. Now I'm writing this post because of yesterday. While I was asleep she went into my phone and messaged my ex pretending to be me. And she asked her if I wanted to meet up with her and my ex agreed, and this is where she blew up at herself (?) for going through my phone and whatnot. She cried and apologized and told me I should meet up with her and that she doesn't deserve me. Basically a total meltdown.\n\nAnother major thing is that me and my ex were pretty adventurous in the bedroom, and she's super disappointed when she brings something up and it isn't my first time. I've resorted to telling her it is sometimes, which is also not ok I understand that.\n\nLook I love this girl. Besides this thing she's perfect. We compliment each other so well, I feel like she's worth it. I want her. But she can't seem to accept that herself, and what she did is obviously not okay. Also now my ex is hurt and mad at me, we were sort of cordial but that's no more. I want my girlfriend to be happy and feel like she deserves to be in a relationship, with me. I don't want her to be like my ex. I can't get through to her and I'm getting tired o. Any input.

I immediately saved all of the files. After that I had to go to work. Important note: We are both teachers, so I had some classes in the afternoon.\n\nWhen I came home he was already on the couch. I confronted him with the videos I found. At this point I only knew the existed, I didn't look at them all that much though. He started to cry right away and told me that there's an explanation to it. He tried to walk up to me but I backed up and locked myself into the bathroom. I told him through the door that he needs to pack his stuff and leave. He wanted me to open the door so he could show me something on his phone. I told him no and that he could explain it first.\n\nSo basically thats his story: Over the last couple of weeks he had to invent a choreography for a school dance. He sucks at dancing and he was embarassed that he had to do it. He didn't want to bring it up, because I always tell him, that he needs to say 'no' to stuff he doesn't want to do (he's the kind that works too much). He took a camera out of school so he could see his choreography later on tape. Because he was so embarrassed, he would film himself while I was in the shower or out with the dog. As soon as I came back from the shower or the walks he would stop and hide the camera (like he would push it to the side). Because the camera had a motion detector it would always turn on when I entered the room. A couple of days ago he watched the videos and immediately deleted all of the videos where I'm on it. The video editor he used apparently made some sort of security copies.\n\nHe didn't want to leave at first. He was scared that I wouldn't be there anymore if he ever came back home. I told him that I would be gone for an hour with our dog and he should pack and leave in this time. When I came home, he was gone.\n\nThe thing is: I WANT to believe him. I really do. But I don't know if I can. There are some reasons why I think I can't:\n\n1. He could've told me. He could've told me that this happened and that it was an accident and that he deleted all the files. He didn't.\n2. Why would he just delete all of my stuff on the videos and put them all together in one file? IF his story checks out, then he at least tried to save those files.\n3. If he cuts the video, why should it save the part you cut away? It doesn't make sense to me, but I'm not very good at video editing, so I don't know.\n\nReasons I could believe him:\n\n1. All of the videos are exactly one minute long. So it seems there was a camera with some sort of motion detector that started to film for one minute after it detected some sort of movement. \n2. He showed me some videos where he dances (but I didn't see a video or like a lot of videos where I could be seen in some part Only THAT he danced at our appartment). \n3. All videos were taken between the 12th and 24th of september. Nothing after or before that. At least the videos that I know of.\n\nOkay. That's all for now. He left me a letter. He told me to not read it until 'it's time'. I don't know what that means. My guess would be that he will try to show me some more videos where it all kind of comes together or something. I don't know. I read the letter already, there's no new information, just a long 'I'm sorry'-thing.\n\nThank you guys so much.\n\nAnd to all of you who think that I should be glad because it shows me that he thinks I'm sexy or something... fuck you.

I had previously noticed that she was \"late\" but my wife and I had a few very late periods and no pregnancy, so I wasn't sure what's what - I'm pretty sure I mentioned trying for a kid in my OP. So, that adds a layer of complexity to all this. \n\nTo answer some of your questions:\n\n1. In general, things were great between my wife and I and have been for years. The real problem we had was in those first few months which involved a number of issues about being in a new relationship. We rarely fought, things were very happy; we had a great sex life, we openly talked about everything. I would never imagine that I'd be sent something like this. \n2. Exclusive? We had never talked about it. It was never stated one way or the other. I assumed we were, but I guess not. \n3. Her ex. He's a writer, let me rephrase a \"writer\" who has never written. Mike and I have met a few times, a few times by accident and once because he was invited to a party we went to. He's not really that interesting/threatening and my wife seems totally nonplussed with him. The last time we saw him was in a bookstore and she didn't at all seem interested. She later said she was glad it didn't workout and was happy without him in her life. \n4. Danielle. Danielle and Katie have been friends for two decades, but the last couple of years things became contentious. Katie and I got together and Danielle's marriage fizzled out. Danielle can be a nice person, but is difficult and I think she's jealous that our relationship was, until that point, very successful. She and I didn't really spend that much time together and she retreated from my wife's life when she found out we were trying for a kid. In the wake of all this, their friendship is ruined, that's for sure, \n\nI was feeling crummy and watched back-to-back episodes of TV and did nothing all day Friday. I literally did nothing beyond getting up to take some medicine/eat and pee. That's it. I didn't broach the subject or even think about it. When my wife got home, I felt better and could think a bit more cogently. She does errands after work which is when she dropped the test on the table and scrammed. A few people commented that we should wait to have kids... well, that's not going to happen. She got back and we \"talked\". \n\nThe story is, and I have no reason to doubt her: She and Mike were dating. She was studying/working and he was writing. He asked to go on a writing retreat with his ex-girlfriend to a cabin somewhere that they could focus on their work. She said no, that it wasn't a good idea for him to be alone with his ex and he went anyway. That translated into his leaving for some prolonged road trip with his ex. They kept in contact but she and I started dating.  We had been together 3 or 4 weeks when he returned and they didn't see each other at first. My wife, like I said, is different from me: I'm a lot more traditional, a lot more formal and am very, very career oriented. When we hit a rough patch, there was more than an insubstantial chance I was going to have to move away and she was going to have to decide to move with me (after 2 1/2 - 3 months of seeing each other) or break up and move on. I had applied for a program and it looked like the local program was going to reject me, but surprisingly, a better, far more well-known university was going to accept me. When things \"went down\" between them, I had been formally rejected and she had to make a decision. I was too focused on admission to even notice/care. They met up at a party and nothing happened, they just talked and had drinks. The second time they met, that's when \"the deed\" happened. She apparently regretted it immediately and the final time was to tell him goodbye and that she was moving. They had a few drinks, \"fooled around\" and then she left. She said she knew it was a mistake, she knew they had no future and nothing in common anymore. Right around the time that they fooled around she and I had a mega fight about moving. It was a lot for someone to deal with (I know) but in the end, she said she wanted to go, but was scared I was going to get to New City in my new program and dump her for a classmate, stranding her. I told her no, and offered her whatever assurances I could. It worked and we did live happily ever after. \n\nI would never have assumed she had cheated. I mean, putting it down, we were in a weird spot and I fully understand why it was a rough time, but the cheating was really not something I could abide by. The whole \"exclusive\" thing came from us moving - I didn't put 2+2 together at the time - I figured (then) that she wanted assurances that moving with me wasn't a huge mistake, not that she had recently bonked her ex who has frequent, and unprotected, sex with many randoms - but again, it also makes sense. From then till about a month after we moved we didn't have sex. Not once. I asked if she had been tested and she just casually remarked \"of course.\" \n\nI was still feeling crappy and didn't know what to do, so I just kind of went back to bed. In reality, for years she's never strayed or been anything but open. She has access to my phone and I can access hers. She doesn't go out with unexplained absences and is more of a homebody. She isn't flirtatious with people or cause drama, so I just sort of stopped caring. I took the weekend to get over this cold and we did some baby shopping online and planned for a follow-up with her doctor. After that, we just didn't talk about it again. Very anti-climactic. \n\nI did bring up the subject of Danielle and pretty directly told her I was done with her. She asked if she thought it would be wise to try and talk to her and I said no. We wrote her an email (using my account) and sent her a response basically telling her that we were done with her and not to bother us again. She responded by saying \"it was a joke!\" and asked that we understand that she was being funny. I found the block function on gmail and added her. My wife noticed that she removed her from FB/Insta and I guess that's that. \n\nNot really a thrilling or interesting update and a few people will be angry that I didn't take a stronger tone/reaction, but I did what I felt was best under the circumstances. Hopefully this is behind us and I can just move on and enjoy bringing a new life into the world.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2073891, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update to Wife\u2019s [29/F] \u201cFrenemy\u201d [30/F] sent me an email outlining my wife\u2019s attempt to reconcile with her Ex [35/M] (and sleeping with him) as we were getting more serious.

I actually knew of this girl from the beginning of our relationship because I had found a hand written love letter from her that he had saved. 6 months into our relationship, I find old messages that they had sent to each other during the first few months of our relationship. These messages consisted of the typical exchange of I love you\u2019s, I miss you\u2019s, You\u2019re the best person to cuddle with, etc, and also, the girl saying \u201cI wish you could have gotten the chance to tie me up\u201d and also my bf explaining to her \u201cI think I should break up with gf\u201d.

She has had a rough life and has told me that she was constantly physically and sexually abused at a very young age by her male family members and eventually partners later on. He was raised in a well off family but he had something traumatic happen in his early 20s that he won\u2019t discuss and has since never left the \u201cfrat bro\u201d mentality, always wanting to drink and party with seemingly little care for important issues. When he proposed, she expressed to me that she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to go through with the engagement because of his inability to connect on a serious level but his family quickly started throwing lots of money at the wedding so she put aside her reservations and went through with it. \n\nForward to last Friday:\n\nWe all went out for drinks after being guilted into it by him. He passed out in the Uber before we even got to the bar because he was already wasted. This pissed all of us off immensely as he has done this several times but we decided to make the best of it and enjoy our time out, taking turns babysitting him. I felt extremely bad for her because it was so embarrassing seeing him barely functioning but refusing to let\u2019s us go home, all of us definitely drinking more than we should have in response. Our friend came and picked us up after we finally had enough and they passed out in the back seat on the way home. I handle my alcohol well and rarely black out or get to non functioning status so I put him to bed and got blankets out and water for the rest of us sober up and pass out on the couch. Her and my friend [26M] have never shown any interest in each other (he\u2019s socially awkward and hits on our other female friend in a really douche-y gross way that we all joke about together when he\u2019s not around) so it never even crossed my mind that anything would happen. We turned on the tv and started a show and they passed out right after so I laid my head down and started to sleep. I heard noises and almost got up to see what it was but then I heard more specifically that she was moaning as he was going down on her. This was extremely awkward for me as I was a foot or so away from them and I completely froze unable to process what was going on. I\u2019m not sure if they had actual sex there but they eventually got up and went to another room to finish the deed I guess.\n\nMy dilemma:\n\nI feel gross and guilty having had to involuntarily be a part of what happened, and am having a hard time trying to face all of them straight faced with this knowledge. I care more for her and feel like I can\u2019t judge her as harshly due to her past and her situation. I want to say something to him about it but I don\u2019t want to lose either one of them as friends. I have a business with them so saying anything about it may cause them to retaliate against me instead of at each other which obviously I don\u2019t want to happen. Should I just hope that one of the guilty parties decides to fess up to what happened? Should I confront her about it or leave it alone? How do I go about getting over what happened? It\u2019s made me extremely uncomfortable and I can\u2019t get the awkwardness of it out of my head.\n\nTL;DR:\nBest friend\u2019s husband got fucked up and embarrassed her so she fucked his friend on the couch while I \u201cslept\u201d a foot away in horror.

It really helped me calm down and think this through. I wanted to update you all on the situation and maybe get your opinion. This is not a very happy update, as I suspected, she has been sexually assaulted, but at least my relationship is fine, and my girlfriend knows I am here to support her and be by her side. \n\nShe slept like a baby and I couldn\u2019t close my eyes all night. It\u2019s now well in the afternoon and I barely took a nap. I made her breakfast and when she woke up, I asked if she wanted to take the day off, so she called in sick. I did as well, I am too tired to go to work anyway. I told her that I was very worried and that I didn\u2019t understand what happened yesterday, that she could tell me if she wanted but I understood if she wasn\u2019t ready. I tried to be as gentle as possible. She kept asking if I hated her and if I was going to break up with her, God that broke my heart. She said she wanted to tell me, and I sat and listened. \n\nIt turns out she was raped by a guy she had considered her friend some years ago. She wouldn\u2019t tell me what happened in detail and I didn\u2019t pressure her. She kept saying she was just a kid, fidgeting and hugging herself. I think it was really bad. She never told anyone, and she thought she was over it. But yesterday she crossed paths with him when she was shopping for food and it all came back. She told me all of this while sobbing and apologising. I told her I believe her, I tried to reassure her and tell her she was safe, and I was there for her. But the girl was shaking. And I feel so useless. \n\nI am so angry; it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish she would tell me who the son of a bitch is, I want to kill the motherfucker. I can\u2019t blame her for never doing anything about it, I understand that she was young and scared. I do wish she had told me before. I didn\u2019t ask why she hadn\u2019t though. I just hugged her while she cried some more, we ordered some food and we\u2019re spending today in bed watching series. \n\nI really don\u2019t know where to go from here. I am afraid to touch her and for it to be a trigger. I understand we need to communicate but I am worried if I ask any questions that she will just shut down on me. I made it clear none of this was her fault, that I love her more than anything and that nothing would change that. But I don\u2019t know what else I can do. \n\nSo reddit, I come to you for help again. I wish no one had to go through this, but I am sure many of you have. Where do I go from here? What do I do? Will she be okay?

We have been married since high school, and (as far as I know, since she COULD be lying to me about her sexual history) we haven't had too many (less than 5) other partners sexually. When she married me, I was in peak shape (I played football). I'll be the first to admit that I've let myself go a bit over the years (about 40 lbs). She, on the other hand, works out daily and eats like a damn pigeon, so she looks as fine as she did in high school (two daughters later, and she's still 'hawt'). She's not necessarily **bugging** me about going, but she has mentioned it like *five* or *six* times. Reading between the lines on this, it's something she REALLY wants to do. For context, she'll halfway hint that she wants sex with me ONCE. If I don't catch those smoke signals while the moon and stars are in perfect alignment, it could be at least another month or two before she'd try again. In contrast, in less that two months, she's brought up the swinging club like five or six times. I love my wife, and I'd do damn near anything for her, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I have some concerns about this:\n\n1) We are not exactly the demographic that I would expect to see in that club. I'm black, and my wife is black. I don't know if our white friends (for example, her BFF and her husband) are just being more open about the possibility of doing this, but our black friends are either not about it at all, or are lying to me when I ask if they've considered swinging.\n\n2) As I've mentioned, I've put on quite a few pounds. One of the things I love about my wife is that she is ***generally*** brutally honest (as in, I've caught her in a whopper or two, but for the most part, she's a straight shooter). She has told me to my face that she is no longer attracted to me sexually. We still have sex, but it's not like she's knocking on my door to get it. I can't get the idea out of my head that we would go and I would see nothing but 21-year old six-pack wielding, horse penis carrying, male gods. And I know you're thinking, \"why don't you just lose some weight?\" I've literally been starving myself since she's mentioned this, but I'm not going to get a six pack next week, no matter what I do. Let's just chalk the six pack up to next year at best, given work, kids, and you know, food.\n\n3) I'm afraid she'll find a younger guy who is better looking, and is a way better plumber than I am. I ***think*** that she loves me, but you never really know. Is she with me out of love, or because I'm a good father, and she doesn't want to be a single parent? Mentally, I think I could deal with her having sex with another man, since I know I wasn't her first. I know as a fact that I could have sex with another woman and that won't affect my marriage (and no, I've never cheated, but guys, you know exactly what I mean on this). I don't care if the vagina made the sun come up in the morning, I'm not leaving my wife and kids for it. Period. That being said, I think she has more options than I do. I don't think movie stars can't stay married because they are worse at it than everyone else, but I think they simply have WAY too many options. I'm not going to do the picture thing, but trust me when I say that if she feels like \"upgrading\" she could do so. I feel sometimes that the moment that she realizes that her being married and having two kids is no deterrent to many men, I'd be through.\n\nSorry for the speech, but I wanted to give some context with the questions.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2072867, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (39M) wife (38F) has told me that her friends have invited her to a swingers club.

I\u2019m still trying to find a way to deal with this internally, and thought I\u2019d update you guys on what was happened in the last week. \n\n\n\nWell, my sister continued to see him for about a week, refusing to talk to me or my parents. Anytime I\u2019d try to contact her she\u2019d leave my texts on read and send my calls to voicemail, so I stopped trying to reach out to her. My mom and dad were (and are) still very disappointed in her actions/behavior and have made it known that what she done wasn\u2019t right. \n\n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t think I could forgive her right now for what she done, and she flew off the handle and began to scream and cuss at me and say that I was making a big deal out of nothing and that I \u201cshould be happy for her.\u201d Yeah.... \n\n\nWell, 2 nights ago my dad picked me up from work and she was in the car, visibly shaken up. I didn\u2019t speak to her (because we are not on speaking terms) and just rode the whole way home silent. Later that night my dad told me that he had to go pick her up from his house and when he did she was balling her eyes out. Guess what happened guys.... He brought his EX girlfriend over to his apartment while my sister was there and proceeded to do the same exact thing.... (he had a few friends over for a party, and apparently my sister didn\u2019t know that the girl was his ex, until one of his friends told my sister who she was...) He had sex with his ex-girlfriend while my sister was downstairs taking to everyone else. \n\n\nHate to see her hurt like this, but karma is a bitch and it always comes around 10 times worse. She keeps telling my mom she feels so stupid and bad for betraying me, and thinking that him and her would actually work. I tried to get her to talk to me about it last night (just so I could kinda say \u201ci told you so\u201d) but she refused to talk about the situation. So, I just think she feels extremely guilty and stupid and almost would rather act like none of this happened then face me. I\u2019ve probably said 5 words to her all day... If she can\u2019t say sorry to me and apologize for having sex with my boyfriend while i\u2019m in there, continuing to stay over at his place for almost a week, and ignoring all of my attempts to talk to her, then she can consider us as good as done. Just because we are sisters does not mean that I can\u2019t remove her and her toxicity from my life. \n\n\nI just want to say thanks for everyone\u2019s comments and concerns and messages. This is truly such a caring community. I\u2019m still a little hurt over all of this but I\u2019ve realized that they both will get what\u2019s coming to them and that\u2019s gave me a little peace lol. I\u2019ve really taken the high-road with this and did not blast the situation on social media like so many suggested. There is so much that I could\u2019ve said and done but in order to not cause a big commotion within the family I\u2019ve decided to just say as little as possible and move on from all of this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2072831, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update: My 20f twin sister slept with the guy 21m I\u2019ve been seeing", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569989301, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbnuff/update_my_20f_twin_sister_slept_with_the_guy_21m/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThePr0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6yop3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569902456, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbnres/my_22m_medical_student_girlfriend_21f_refuses_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbnres", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 82, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbnres/my_22m_medical_student_girlfriend_21f_refuses_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1569902476, "score": 170, "selftext": "So we've been together for over two years now, and living together for 1 year. We just moved into a house that has an extra room that we turned into an office for her study in. It's very nicely lit, decorated, quiet, and organized. The problem is that she refuses to use it. She seems to prefer to study in the living room, the bedroom, or in the kitchen, and demands that I be quiet, and to not talk to her, while she's studying in these areas. She also gets upset if I ever suggest inviting my friends over while she's studying. I'm losing my mind because we're paying higher rent for more space so she can have her own space to work without distractions, but insists on using every other possible space to get her work done. I cannot watch TV, videos, play video games, listen to music, or anything that makes any kind of noise when she's studying in these areas. I also cannot talk to her at all when she's studying. She studies at least 8 hours a day, and usually at home, meaning a really cannot use these spaces until she's done studying, and when she's done studying it's only what *she* wants to do since she studies so much. I'm in school too and have a heavy workload and would like to be able to relax when I am at home.\n\nI have asked her many times to study in the office if she wants quiet and for me to not talk to her, but she insists that it's not a big deal and that she doesn't want to use the office.

My husband and I have been happily married for over 10 years. In that time he's never done anything to make me suspect he was not being faithful to me. He really is a wonderful man and I consider myself extremely lucky to have found him, which is why the current situation confuses me so much.\n\n\nA couple of days ago he forgot his phone in my handbag after we went shopping. I went to have lunch with a friend afterwards and wanted to use his phone to call home and tell him I still have his phone. But when I unlocked his phone I noticed he had Facebook messenger installed on his phone. My husband is not the social media type so I was curious and opened the app and my heart sank. There were lots of messages from a woman. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. \n\n\nI spent the next couple of hours reading through the entire chat history. Turns out for months he's been talking to a 17 year old girl who lives in Florida (we're in Chicago). The reason I'm so confused about what to do is because nothing sexual  appears to be happening. They texted about all sorts of things and the times she tried to steer the conversation in a sexual direction, he shut it down pretty quickly and changed the topic. \n\n\nHe also wasn't trying to hide the fact that he's married. On the contrary, some of the things he told her about me was actually very sweet. Having read their entire chat history, I'm fairly sure this girl is smitten with my husband although nothing overtly inappropriate appears to be happening between them. \n\n\nWhat bothers me so much about this is the fact that we're normally very open with one another and he's never once mentioned this to me. I really want to confront him over this, even if it is just to find out what's going on. But I did invade his privacy by reading his messages without his permission and I'm scared it's going to damage our relationship if he finds out I did this.

We used to play a lot of video games together in our spare time. It\u2019s a really fun way to spend time together and I love it. \n\nAbout 2-3 months ago, he started spamming League ranked because the season\u2019s ending soon and he wanted to see how high he could climb. I also play League so I do understand the end-of-season grind, and I was super supportive of him at first. I would watch his matches and cheer him on. I was so happy for him because he gets super excited when he ranks up and it\u2019s cute. I really do like seeing him happy.\n\nAfter the first month of this, I got kind of bored just sitting around watching him play so I started to play my own games while he was ranking up. I knew he was trying to focus on League so I tried not to bother him too much. I did miss playing games with him though, so whenever I saw that he wasn\u2019t in a match, I would ask if he wanted to play something with me. Most of the time, he'd say that he wanted to focus on ranked at the moment so maybe another time. The few times that we did play together just made me feel like shit. It felt like I was forcing him to play with me. He didn\u2019t seem to be enjoying it at all. It made me feel terrible so I would just tell him I was tired and that we could stop. He would immediately jump back into a ranked queue. After a while I pretty much just stopped asking him to do stuff with me because I didn\u2019t want to bother him.\n\nThis has been going on for months and I just feel so lonely and sad all the time. I keep telling myself that he\u2019ll get bored of spamming League or that he\u2019ll reach his goal and stop but I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll happen anymore. Why is he even so hung up on his rank?? Is it really worth pushing people out of your life for? How does he not realize our relationship is suffering right now? I\u2019m not even asking him to stop playing League completely. I just wish he\u2019d take a break and spend time with me for a little, but he just spams League non stop.\n\nIt kills me because I don\u2019t think he really even cares. It doesn\u2019t seem like he misses spending time together because he\u2019s so fucking hung up on playing ranked all the time. I just don\u2019t understand. I guess I don\u2019t really mean that much to him as I thought. I\u2019m just so sad because this is most likely the end of our relationship.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to talk to him about it because I don't want to guilt him into spending time with me again. I just wish he would want to spend time with me on his own :( \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice would be appreciated.

She would be devastated. \n\n\nI am a 19 year old guy who was enrolled into business school last year, I am not so great at studies but I'll call myself an above average kid. Life was going out pretty great. Money was tight as my father was a teacher at the local school and my mum used to work at the local supermarket. We sometimes did have to go through some stressful times but as a family we pulled it together because sometimes you have to make some hard choices in life. For us it was my education. My father always told me that eductaion is the most important thing you can give to yourself. People can take away your wealthy possessions but they can't take away your education from you. \n\n5 months ago my mom was diagnosed with stage three pancreatic cancer and we were devestated by the news. My father and I were there by her side at all times and we were just praying that we did the most for her. Savings were being drained out of our house because these things are hella expensive. My college funds were also used up in the process as I had applied for an education loan for my second and third year of college (which was a total of 6200$) so I didn't care about it. My mom is the most important person in my life. I would do anything for her. \n\n15 days ago I was out with my friends, I had to de stress so my parents adviced me that I should go watch a movie. We were halfway through the movie when I got a call from my uncle(dads friend). He asked me to come back home as soon as possible, I kept asking him what's wrong, but he didn't tell me anything and insisted that I comeback home immediately. I got this feeling that something isn't right. I started panicking. I thought something had happened to my mom. I grabbed my friend and headed for my house. Throughout the way I kept trying to call dad up. He wasn't picking. I was scared as hell. I reached home and I found out that my father had passed away because of a heart attack. It was all so sudden that I couldn't even process it. \n\nMy father's friend was there. He held me and I broke down. I couldn't even imagine what horror God was making me go through. I went to my mum's room and she was crying. She was alone. I held her and she broke down in my arms. This was all too heavy for her. \n\nWe had a small funeral with our closest's relatives and a few friends. Things were pretty calm until they were there. Things got bad when everyone had left. It was me and mum all alone. We cried for an another couple of hours until my mom told me that I had to stay strong. Not for her but for myself. She told me she knows how cancer works. Soon I'll be all alone in this world. That scared me to my bones. I a still a kid. I dont want to loose both my parents. \n\n\nThings were getting back to normal. Normal didn't mean laughing. But innocence was screaming at me and mocking me. A week ago I got a letter from the bank that my education loan had been denied because my father had a bad credit score and he was the whole and sole guarantor of the loan. This hit me in my stomach so bad. I felt dizzy. I haven't told this to my mum yet and I am scared as hell. \n\nI have no idea what do I do now. I dont want to stress my mom out and I sure has hell do not want to drop out of college. Give me some advice guys. What do I do? \n\nTL:DR business school student, mum diagnosed with cancer.

I needed two weeks off. I was granted the time off, and found a flight on Wednesday.\n\nThat evening I broke down. I wasnt planning on telling my boyfriend that I was leaving, but I needed to get stuff off of my chest. My heart wanted to give him a chance to explain himself. At that point he still didnt know I was aware of his nude pic thing. So I asked him to please be honest with me and just tell me anything else he was hiding from me. He told me there was nothing else. I called him out on it and told him I went through the messages. Then he suddenly remembered, but told me he hadn't done it in over a year. I knew that was a lie because I've seen chat bubbles on his phone from girls I knew he was getting pics from only a month prior, so I called him out again for deleting the messages. He never admitted he was actively doing it.\n\nWe had a long talk about how I cant trust him anymore. He was incredibly hurt. We both cried a lot. I told him the only way I would ever consider staying is he went to a therapist and got his shit sorted out. I told him I was going to stay with my mom for a while and figure things out for myself. He agreed that would be best for me. \n\nI've been away a week now. Hes seen two separate therapists, and told me he didnt like either of them. He said he felt judged and they were rude to him. I have a feeling he just expected them to tell him hes fine, and when they didnt he freaked out. They both told him he shouldnt be in a relationship. He didnt like that either.\n\nNow tonight is the eve of me flying back. I sent him a message to let him know I would be back tomorrow and he seemed upset. He wanted me to stay longer. I asked why and he told me he wasnt ready to face me. The alone time was good for him. I knew at that point it was over. \n\nAfter a couple hours back and forth, I started getting mad. I kept asking straight forward questions and couldnt get a straight forward response. He finally told me that all he wants is for me to be happy and breaking up isnt going to do that. So I asked him, my feelings aside, what do you really want to do? And he said he wanted to be alone.\n\nSo I told him we need to break up. \n\nIf the only reason he was staying in this relationship is that he didnt want to hurt me, then he obviously didnt really love me anymore. \n\nSo we broke up. Over fucking text. 5 and a half years together and we broke up over text because he was too much of a pussy to call me. I've been begging him to call me all night but he wont do it. \n\nI am hurting so much right now.\n\nTomorrow I fly back. We have agreed that I will stay as long as I need to to sort the finances and save enough to leave. He has offered to pay off all the debts we incurred. While that does seem awfully generous, I know it's because he knows the debt is really all his. \n\nI'm so angry. How do I end up with the short stick in this situation? I leave my whole life behind for this. I have to start all over again. \n\nI'm not really looking for any more advice. I just needed to vent that. \n\nI hope I can be ok again some day.\n\nI love him so much.

My girlfriend, K, and her friend, S, have a mutual friend, M. S used to live in a separate unit of the same house with M. The first time K and I met M, she came home in the middle of the night drunk with an infant. I don't know if she was driving at the time. She left the infant sleeping in a carseat outside with K and me and proceeded to go upstairs to her unit with the person she came home with and S. We talked about how strange it was that she would leave her baby outside, alone, at night, with people she had never seen before. Eventually the child woke up and started crying. K comforted the baby and called S to tell M to get the baby. I commented about how messed up it must be as a baby to wake up alone, outside, at night. \n\nOver the next several months, S becomes closer friends with M. K and I express our concerns to each other about the relationship and M's abilities as a parent. Both S and M feed off of each other's uninhibited energy and neither seem to check the other. \n\nA few months ago, K started periodically caring for the baby while M went to work. I was perfectly ok with this until I found out that M isn't paying K at all and I also observed M would routinely ask at the last minute if it was ok if she went out with friends before picking up her child. I felt like K was being taken advantage of and told her so, but she disagreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to about 5 nights ago. K and S are caring for the child at our house when I get home from work. They eventually put the kid to bed and we all stay up watching funny videos. Eventually, well after midnight, M comes to pick up the kid, and she is absolutely trashed. She's being loud, not making any sense, trying to wrestle K, wakes up the baby, then argues that she didn't wake up the baby. They went and got the baby, talked a bit more at the door, then M and S went outside. I asked K if M was driving and she said yes. I told her that M is absolutely wasted and cannot drive. K went outside. I considered going with her because I knew that I definitely wouldn't let M drive. However, M is not my friend, K and S are both adults, and I chose to put my faith in them to handle it. 20 minutes later they K and S came back in. I asked if M drove off with the baby and they said yes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI flipped out. I yelled at both of them. I told them that I couldn't believe they would allow her to drive off with that child. I told them I was disappointed in both of them, that they are terrible caretakers and unbelievably irresponsible. I said these things while standing and yelling with both of them sitting on the couch. They said that they gave M options, but she didn't take them. I shouted that M only gets two options: either stay here for the night, or uber home and let one of us take her car and child to her house. I told them they have no business looking after children. They both have extensive experience as nannies for families, so I couldn't believe they could allow such a thing to happen. I said that M is no longer welcome here, then I then went to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted them in a group chat the next day, reiterating my point, admitting fault at not stopping M myself, and telling them that I hope this is a learning experience. S texted me back, basically begrudgingly acknowledging that they made a mistake, but that it was now in the past and they will do better next time, while making excuses for the situation. That wasn't good enough for me, I texted back, and all that really came of it was S refusing to speak about it anymore, putting words in my mouth, and checking out. K responded basically the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nK didn't speak to me for 3 days after. I finally had a talk with her. She was detached and seemed done with everything. We spent a day focusing on rekindling our relationship, which had been suffering before all this. \n\nWe tried again to discuss this last night, to no avail. K doesn't see the implications that I do, and doesn't want to discuss it anymore. I, however, feel totally unsatisfied with her answers. She says that her friends are not comfortable with me and that this situation has nothing to do with me. She told me that she and S have had a talk with M about the situation, and that M knows she fucked up and has promised it won't happen again. When pressed for details about what would happen if it did, she told me that she and S told M that if she does this again, they won't babysit the child for x amount of time. I laughed at that. K also cited her loyalty to her friends as a reason for her position in this situation. The conversation ended unresolved, with K telling me that I have a need to be heard and understood and plan for things ahead, but that she thinks simply and doesn't want to relive the situation anymore. She would rather address it again if it presents itself. I don't feel confident in her ability to adequately address the situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want K to be able to put her foot down and stand up for this child if she has to, even if it means calling the cops on M. She doesn't seem able to see that she could very well be saving this child's life, or maybe just unwilling to look at it in such a tough way. K thinks that I am being overbearing and talking down to them. She thinks I was needlessly rude to her and her friends and wishes I would just drop it and trust them to do better in the future.\n\nK and I have been dating for over 2 1/2 years and have talked a lot about marriage and kids. This situation is raising huge red flags for me. I see now that her friends hold a more important position to her than I do, and I am no longer confident in her ability to make hard decisions in the best interests of a child. This situation has made her and her friends look VERY immature to me, and I am worried for the future of our relationship. Am I justified? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend and her friend allowed another friend to drive drunk with her toddler. I made a big deal out of it.

My husband and I have been married for about a year now. I love him with all my heart, and we haven't have any issues in our relationship so far (been together for about 6 years now).\n\nMy cousin and I have always gotten along well and been close, although she was quite a bit closer to my sister when we were growing up. Now that we're both adults, we seem to get along better though. She's extremely intelligent (just got her Master's degree and has worked for the UN) and very beautiful.\n\nAbout two years ago she and my husband (then fianc\u00e9) hit it off. They had met a few times before, but idk something was different about this time. She's really politically active, and my husband, who is works for the government and is quite liberal, immediately \"got\" her and they went out for \"one drink\" while I stayed home because I was tired. They didn't get back until past midnight, and I could hear them shouting and watching youtube videos and being dumb drunks. Didn't think much about it and went to bed.\n\nFast forward to a year ago. Her sister (my cousin) was getting married. We had a bonfire on the beach the day before the rehearsal dinner, and once again, I got tired so I went home early with the majority of the crowd. The only people to stay on the beach were my husband, my cousin, and my brother-in-law. According to my husband, they just smoked a little (we live in CA) and talked. \n\nThings were weird the next day at the rehearsal. They kept making eyes at each other, but otherwise didn't really talk much, which I thought was odd because they're always the loudest people at a party. I chalked it up to paranoia and moved on.\n\nWhich brings us to today. My cousin started a job working with a nearby university and moved into the area. We've had her over for dinner a few times, and it's been fine. My husband is involved with the local government, so they've been meeting a 1-2 times a week to discuss work. Some events have happened since then to cause the paranoia to rise again:\n\nI caught him looking at her Instagram. He was out on the porch and you can see through the window and I had basically a perfect vantage point to see him going through months old pictures of her...mostly selfies or portraits. I then started looking her up every now and then and he likes almost everything she posts, which is fine, he's very active on social media, but still.\n\nI went to grab a coffee right around the corner from our place, where they happened to be discussing work. They didn't see me, but they were sitting pretty close (shoulders definitely touching). They weren't flirting; they seemed to be hyper-focused on the documents that they were studying. But the way they worked and looked together. I dunno.\n\nMy sister and brother-in-law came to visit. I had breakfast with my BIL and I off-handedly mentioned that my husband and Nina were working together on some project. My BIL got really quiet and said something along the lines of \"Yeah, they've always been pretty close.\" I ignored it, but then we had her over for dinner that night, and my husband touched my cousin's arm when she said something he agreed with and lingered for a couple seconds. My BIL immediately caught my eye and there was like this silent communication thing that told me that he saw it too. I cornered him about it the next day and asked him about it. He didn't say much, other than he also noticed that they had a connection. He told me not to worry too much, that my husband loves me and would never betray me and that it's just a \"flirtationship.\"\n\nSomething about it doesn't sit right with me. I don't think things have progressed with them (call it a gut feeling) but I'm more worried about him actually developing feelings for her.\n\nHow should I approach this? Is it even worth losing sleep over? My husband has never given any verbal indication that he's into her, it's all been just things I've noticed.

She had a very good paying job and seemed like she was heading in the right direction in life. At the time I never understood why she would want to date me in that state and she always said I had potential to be something great. I didnt really have any goals or motivation to progress my life in the same regard as she did. I wasnt depressed or anything to that sort but I guess I was content with my shitty life at that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe made this statement very early in our relationship that always stuck with me. She told me pretty much what her goals were. She said she wanted to have a house, a kid and be married and then asked me if I wanted those same things. I didnt know how to respond at the time but she pretty much said this is what I am looking for. If you dont want to work towards that with her then she didnt think it would work in the long run. After some time I made it my goal to give those things she wanted to her. I moved out of my friends and in with her. She helped me find a very good paying job. My life started to get better. While I was living with her she got tired of her good paying job and we both agreed it wasnt good for her mental health so she a got a job paying a lot less and we made it (financially) work. I proposed to her and she accepted of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is were everything gets weird. At the time we shared everything and spent a lot of time together. We shared one car so I would bring her to work and pick her up when I was out. We fought a lot over stupid petty shit but we were in love. I would do anything for her. My girl is one of those people that wear her heart on her sleeve so when something at work happened she would always vent to me. She is hot headed and I am very calm and collective so it worked. She started talking to me about all the people she worked with and stuff and I grew to know them through her experiences. I noticed she started to talk about one guy she worked with in particular a lot more. Lets call him Joe. I simply ignored it because I am not a jealous person and thought it she would never cheat on me. Then one day she told me there was a work party that they were throwing for there staff. Her company she worked for did this pretty often so I didnt think much of it. It was kind of far away (about an hour and half) so I just asked her if she needed me to pick her up and she said no. She would get a ride home with one of her co workers. Time goes by and its 12AM. I texted her and she said they were on the way back. Time goes on and its 2:30AM. She finally came in the door and was kinda drunk. ( I knew there would be alcohol involved.) I was kinda pissed because before this point she was always with me and had never came home so late. So we got into it. We fought for a while and it Im pretty sure it ended up coming out that Joe brought her home. She didnt really deny it but said he was bringing home a cpl others so it would be ok. We fight and I go to bed.   \n\n\nI started to get suspicious of something going on between these two but didnt want to acknowledge it to come off like the crazy jealous boyfriend. At this point I had no proof of anything and I thought we were madly in love so I dismissed these feelings as hearsay. Then maybe a month or two later we were getting ready for bed and at the time her mother was going through something. She would always sleep with her phone near her(as did I) It was like 12 in the morning and her phone keep going of like text were coming in. Let me state I would never go through her phone and til this day never have again but I was concerned about her mother and though something bad may have happened. So I just opened up her phone and saw snap chat messages from Joe. My heart sank into my chest and something told me not to but I opened it. It was a message saying \"I love you\" with a picture of him. I instantly woke her up and asked her what the fuck this shit is. It disappeared because that it is snap chat so I couldnt show her. She said idk and heavily insisted that it was ment for Joes baby mother and was sent to her in accident. I should also add I knew she talked to him and a lot of her co workers to some degree. We argued for a while but she was very convincing and I choose to believe her. We would continue to get in arguments about this over the whole course of our marriage and she admitted to me that she like the attention he gave her but nothing ever came of it. I didnt really have any proof she did anything else so I tried to believe her as time went on but always felt some way about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months go by and she finds out she is pregnant. I am filled with so much joy that I will be a father. Time goes on and few months after the announcement of pregnancy we got married. I ended up starting a business and it somewhat is successful. Life goes on, we buy a house, two cars and live the happy dream life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs crazy it this may sound but the other night I had this crazy dream out of nowhere. My wife and I have not really been fighting as of late so I dont know where it came from but it was pretty much reliving the night she came home at 2 in the morning drunk. In the dream she told me she cheated on me. I woke up out of anger and yelled at her to fuck off. She was really confused and kept asking me what was wrong but I feel asleep again.  I woke up that morning and remembered everything about the dream and started to think about all of that stuff that happened back then. The shit was really bothering me. She woke up finally and asked what was that all about last night? I simply said, \"I know you cheated on me and I forgive you.\" I honestly didnt really know if she did but had this feeling to press her on it. She just looked at me and looked shocked. I said, \"Please just tell me the truth and we can work things out.\" She said, \" I am so sorry...\" I literally couldnt believe it. I still cant. I started to ask her questions and it turns out she had some kind of relationship with him for 6 months right before we got married. Idk if it was a fuck buddy kind of thing or something more. I asked her about the I love you snap and she told me that he did love her. And that she never said it back to him which I do not believe. She also told me she had sex with him among other things more then once. I started to think since this all happened around the time my kid was born so maybe my child is not mine.... I asked her and she said there is no way that it is possible because they used protection and ended it one month before my son was supposedly conceived. She keeps apologizing to me and saying that she wanted to tell me but didnt know how to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am literally numb and dont now how to feel. Even tho she did this very selfish act back then I am almost positive she isnt that person anymore. She used to be kind of needy for attention from anyone who gave it to her and she isnt like that now. She is a good mother and wife but in the same I feel kinda like our whole marriage was based on a lie. I spent most of my life with her trying to give her the things she wanted and now Im questioning why and what for. This happened Friday and I kinda just been keeping my distance because I dont know what to say. I dont even know if I want to get a paternity test for my son because I love him with all of my being and I dont want to love him less or even think of that whole ordeal.\n\nShould I throw away this life I built? Get a test? Forgive her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQUICK VERSION: My wife cheated on me before we got married and now my kid may or may not be mine.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2071922, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (M29) just found out my wife (F26) of 4 years cheated on my right before we got married.

I have had my cat for 5 years. Her name is, appropriately, Kitty. She means the world to me, and I rescued her off the street when she was a kitten and I was at a terribly low point in my life. She helped me change my entire attitude and really gave me something else to live for when I needed it most. \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend for 9 months. Besides my cat, she\u2019s the most important thing in my life. I\u2019ve known about her pet allergy for the entire relationship, and sometimes it would bother her, but never terribly so. I\u2019ve also taken a lot of precautions to limit the amount of hair and dander in my household for my girlfriend\u2019s sake. She recently moved in when her lease ran up, rather than renew for a whole new year. In hindsight, it was probably a little too early, but it made sense for her to not sign on till September 2020 when my lease is up in March of next year; which would allow us to pick an apartment together. \n\nRecently, my girlfriend has started getting bit by unknown bugs, whereas I am not, and her allergies have become worse. We\u2019ve taken all the precautions and steps necessary to deal with fleas (though we\u2019ve never seen fleas on or off the cat). However, the bites have persisted, no matter what room of the apartment she\u2019s in. Yesterday we did a deep clean of the apartment, and felt confident in our work. However, she received another bite shortly after, and broke down in frustration over the situation. Afterwards, she nonchalantly asked if I would considered giving Kitty away, which made me deeply upset, which then made her deeply upset. Now, she\u2019s telling me that she feels incredibly hurt that she\u2019s competing with an animal she feels no attachment to, despite understanding what Kitty means to me.\n\nI completely understand her position and I know how frustrating it must be to feel so paranoid and unsafe from pests in your own home. She stated that if it continues and I don\u2019t get rid of Kitty, she\u2019ll be forced to move out which would essentially be the end of our relationship, because Kitty is only 5. I\u2019m incredibly conflicted because it\u2019s not like this is an incredibly new relationship that I can just end with little thought because of an allergy that is completely valid, but also I can\u2019t bear to part with my cat that is responsible for me still being here today.

We've been together for a year and a half and completely fell in love. It was like a fairy tale. He is so wonderful - kind, sensitive, loving, generous, trustworthy, ambitious, everything. We share a passion for road cycling and mountain biking, we grew up in the same state about an hour away from each other, we have so much in common. And we love each other. \n\nMy concern is that he has a best friend who he has been living with on and off for about 15 years. He fully financially supports this friend. This friend, we'll call him \"J\", doesn't have a job, drinks to excess multiple times a week, and basically does not leave his room during the day. This friend, J, also thinks he is an evil wizard. They both believe in the I Ching, which is an ancient Chinese divination system. My boyfriend calls J his life coach, and whenever my boyfriend has a question about his career, or life in general (I'm not sure to what extent he consults and relies on the I Ching) he asks, J, who throws coins and interprets the I Ching for my boyfriend. I'm concerned about the level of influence J has on my boyfriend's decision making. I'm also just not a fan of J in general - he is loud, egotistical, thinks he is evil (thinks he caused the recent earthquakes in California), drinks too much and doesn't respect women. \n\nAs questions about our future have come up, I've told my boyfriend that I do not want to live with J. I told him I don't care about the financial support, but I want to get married one day and have a family and don't want to live with J. But this is a deal breaker for my boyfriend.

She didn't interrupt once but I could see her start crying and she hugged me. She kept asking me why I didn't tell her sooner and that she was supposed to take care of us. I begged her not to blame herself and asked if she could be there when I talk to him tomorrow. She agreed.\n\nMy brother, to my surprise, readily agreed to meet the next day.  When we met, he apologized and got on his knees. He cried (rare for him) and took all the blame. To me, it seemed genuine and I could see he had suffered a lot from this.  \n\nI was most interested in why he did this on several occasions with both my sister and I. We don't really talk about emotional problems in our family (not uncommon for Hispanic families) but, combined with a lot of \"I don't knows\", he explained he was depressed and felt powerless. Specifically, my mother, whom he gave his entire paycheck too each month, would give him nothing back and lied about paying his car bills with it**.** At the age of 21, his car was towed due to failed payments and he couldn't even buy a pair of sneakers (he wasn't in school either so he was stuck at home whenever he wasn't at work). \n\nI also asked if he had sexual thoughts about underage children since then and, in a disgusted tone, he replied of course not. This didn't make sense and I knew I could never trust him to be around my children (if I were to have any) and so I wouldn't really want him to be in my life.  I said I couldn't forgive him then and now, but that I hoped coming clean with this and telling his wife will be the start of an honest, satisfactory life. I wished him no ill, left, and let him talk to my older sister alone.\n\nLater that night, I messaged him for the last time telling him that I strongly believe he was lying about having those thoughts, that it was okay to have them because he can't control that, and that he should see a therapist if at all possible. I proceeded to block him on all forms of social media.\n\nOverall, I feel a closure that I hadn't had in nearly 10 years. I had repressed these memories until having a challenging psychedelic experience where the events newly resurfaced. During the trip, I couldn't surrender to the shame and discomfort I felt regarding the experience but realized in the months following the trip that it was a primary cause of the shame and low self-esteem I felt since high school. Hearing #metoo survivors also helped me realize I was not to blame for this.\n\n**TLDR;** After telling my older sister the truth, I confronted my brother and he seemed genuinely apologetic but denied having pedophilia-related thoughts. I told him to please tell his wife and see a therapist and then broke off contact. The #metoo movement and a challenging psychedelic experience helped a lot in overcoming this long-held trauma.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2071352, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE: Mom wants me to reconnect with my (24F) brother (30) who sexually abused me when I was 15", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569946659, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbdya7/update_mom_wants_me_to_reconnect_with_my_24f/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bachthrway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4p6cpxlz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569859255, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbdp1j/fianc\u00e9_33f_watched_a_stripper_masturbate_for_her/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbdp1j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 342, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbdp1j/fianc\u00e9_33f_watched_a_stripper_masturbate_for_her/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1569859295, "score": 195, "selftext": "The party was Saturday. She had hers and I \\[29M\\] also had my Bachelor Party that night. Her bridesmaids and friends hired a stripper for her. I knew in advance and she was giddy over it, and I trust her not to fuck some stripper, so I supported her. Some of my guys were uncomfortable about hiring a stripper, so we set it up such that we go out, have fun, then only the people who want to go will come to a Strip Club with me at the end of the night and do our thing.\n\nI've been to strip clubs before, so my picture in my head is a lap dance, see some naked bodies, and if you want more, you go upstairs and pay for more. I didn't have any intention to go up and pay more, so we got a few lap dances, had some fun and called it a night.\n\nHer stripper came to a friend's house. We woke up in different places Sunday morning and teased each other we had crazy nights on the phone. Then I went to go pick her up and she let casually slip the stripper jerked off into a towel. That she was taken into a room alone cause all the other girls didn't want to see it and that she played with her boobs for him while he jerked off and came into a towel. She doesn't really hide anything from anyone, so she let it slip. I was not happy being shocked like that. I was taken aback, cause in my head a stripper doesn't perform sex acts. To me, cumming is a sex act. I got a little jealous but then chalked it up to it being a bachelorette party. I asked her if anything else other than dancing/grinding happened and she said no. \n\nLater in the day, I let it ruminate more and kept getting grossed out that some guy did that in front of her. I mean... Louis CK got in trouble for the same thing, so clearly someone draws a line there. So she starts getting messages from her bachelorette group and some pictures and videos come up. She says she wants to show me, but we're headed into a wedding vendor meeting, so I say not now. As I said, she doesn't hide anything, so while in the middle of the  vendor meeting she shows me a picture of her on the floor (clothed) and whispers to me \"I had spanx on!\", the stripper in assless chaps in the 69 position. I'm not even thinking that this is in the middle of the dance and he could've been in that position for a fraction of a second for the picture. All my head goes to is that he's trying to give her oral sex. It took everything I had to not burst in anger there. All going through my head that moment is that she 1) doesn't even let ME go down on her, and some random dude is now all up in that area and 2) what the hell else went on at this thing that she didn't mention. We left the vendor and it became too much for me that I got very angry, screamed, and very immaturely said I want to cancel this wedding and that I don't want to hear anything or see any of the videos. In my head my trust was broken and if the guy jerked off in front of her, what isn't to say that he didn't try to perform oral sex on her.\n\nThe next several hours I calmed down, word reached mutual friends who asked me to not throw this away. A female friend that was at the bachelorette supports my fiance that nothing crazy happened and she certainly did not cheat on me. She was drunk and it was part of the show, and that we are both at fault for not discussing boundaries beforehand. \n\nI conceded that if someone took a picture of me mid-lap dance that it could look like i'm doing something wrong. I asked to see the videos she was trying to show me earlier. I felt the jealousy build inside me. The stripper was definitely overly touchy... he came out and started kissing her immediately when she had a blindfold on, started groping her a little and bite-motioned her nipples in the video. Other clips got a bit crazier-- he air humped her, her with her legs around is waist and him gyrating. The picture I reacted to earlier there was enough distance between his face and her crotch and his crotch and her face that I had to concede I was overreacting.\n\nWhile I'm not thrilled about a lot of those things, they are technically part of lapdances, so I can't be upset about them. The air humping thing sucks, but that too I have chalked up to being part of the night. We talked it through and I had to concede this is both our faults for not communicating limits and not marking what I was uncomfortable with. \n\nThis morning all I could think about was how grossed out I feel about this. She has said she would do the night all over again cause of how much love she was showered with-- that she didn't enjoy the stripper as much as other parts of the night and that if she'd known I was uncomfortable with the masturbation that she would not have gone through with it. She thought it was gross but says she let it happen because it was part of the \"package\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just really can't stop being grossed out by it. I can't have a double standard about a dude gyrating on her if I had a girl gyrating on me... but today I am only thinking about that dude's bodily fluids... and the fact that it probably got on her dress and ugh.\n\nIt's a spiral in my head and i'm not trying to let it be. I'm not a prude, I definitely have a higher sex drive than her, and feel more jealousy than anything. The fact that she was hyper sexual with a stranger and that I get that level of sexuality from her, but that it's always preempted by some level of prudishness.\n\nWhile I am not cancelling the wedding, i'm having a hard time with this. I can't even tell if my trust in her is shaken or that i'm just being held back by jealousy. \n\nFor what it's worth, there are times when she has been hypersexual with me and encourages me to speak to what I want out of our sex life. We tried to do the make up sex thing and tried a new position and while it helped me feel better, out of anything that happened with her at her Bachelorette, that this jerking off thing is really bugging me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2071315, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Fianc\u00e9 [33F] watched a stripper masturbate for her Bachelorette Party", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569945642, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbdp1j/fianc\u00e9_33f_watched_a_stripper_masturbate_for_her/", "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "wls": 3}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwraadviceneeded", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4p6509ao", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569858216, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbdfzo/my_longterm_girlfriend_started_crying_when_we/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbdfzo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 65, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbdfzo/my_longterm_girlfriend_started_crying_when_we/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1569858217, "score": 165, "selftext": "  \n\nI feel so horrible, I feel like a monster.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. You know the drill. I tried posting this on r/relationships but apparently the mods there said it was inappropriate. So I am trying my luck here for guidance.\n\nI've been with this guy for 3 years and I moved into his apartment some time last year. I love him to bits but lately I've been thinking about packing my things and leaving.\n\nMy boyfriend has always been a boisterous type and he's a turbo nerd. He loves his superheroes, anime, gaming, you name it. Whenever we watch anything, especially anime, he'll talk through the whole thing often criticizing the relationships the writers made for the characters, talk about his \"one true pairings,\" and he'll express how certain set pieces in the story make him feel. I'm not into it really but I'll take time to watch it with him because he makes it rather entertaining and I support his hobbies and interests. He'll wear his emotions on his sleeve too. He has no problem laughing, cheering, and crying over what's going on and I love him for that. I love all of him for that. But lately that's all changed and he's no longer the person I once loved anymore.\n\nAbout 7 months ago we binge watched an anime called \"Loveless\" based on a recommendation by his friend. It was decent, albeit incredibly fucked up and depressing. The show tackles sex, abuse, memory loss, psychotic breaks, broken homes, love being equal to pain, that sort of shit. However I was moreso shocked that my boyfriend was completely quiet and focused the entire time. He was also quiet the rest of the day. It bled into the next morning too... And even for a few days. He wouldn't really speak or express any kind of emotion. I tried asking him what was up with him and even he didn't know. I thought maybe the show was too much for him and he was still trying to process it. So I paid it no mind and hoped it'd clear up soon.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks he somewhat returned to normal but he wasn't really all that there. It seemed like he was trying to force his boisterous personality rather than it coming naturally to him. Throughout the next few weeks I'd find him quietly sitting at his PC either playing games or looking at websites and watching videos. I was getting really worried about him. He also picked up the Loveless books and read them. However he would need to take breaks in between each book because each time he finished one he'd be out of it again for a few hours or a day. This type of behavior was way out of character for him. This went on for about 2 months until he finished the last book he had.\n\nThen, one day, a breakthrough happened but not what I expected at all. He began having a soft smile on his face pretty much 24/7. His voice and speech were soft, calming and often times philosophical in nature. He would stare at pretty much everything just admiring it, smile and all, as if he was just high on life and enjoying every little aspect of it. He was a lot more gentle with me when we had sex or being intimate often treating me like a delicate flower that he cherished so much. It was weird. Gone were the days of ups and downs and varying degrees of loud. It made me bitter but I'd be lying if I said he didn't look content and at peace. So I bit my lip.\n\nAt least for a little bit. I missed the man I once knew. I asked him what is going on with him. Normally confronting him about something would make him squirm. Instead he looked away and smiled, blushing a little, and admitted he owed me an explanation. He took me to his PC and he showed me all these blogs and websites he's favorited talking about otherkin and the different kinds of otherkin that there are. That's when he dropped the bomb on me.\n\nHe is fictionkin to Soubi; one of the main characters from Loveless. Meaning he thinks he is Soubi's reincarnation. He believes he IS Soubi.\n\nI didn't know what to make of it at first. It sounded to utterly ridiculous and it is. How can you be the reincarnation of something that isn't real? A thing some writer or writers made up in their head? A piece of fiction. Yet, like I said before, he seemed much happier. He said Soubi resonates within him at a level that shakes him to his very core. He explained that the show made him have his awakening. He says he has Soubi's memories and has flashbacks of Soubi's childhood and such. So I accepted it and told him I'd love him regardless. He was happy with that.\n\nI spent time getting used to the new adjustments I had to make. He's very happy that he can be \"himself\" around me more. But things got weirder and weirder. He wanted me to start calling him Soubi when we were at home over his real name. Fine, whatever, then he'd start casually calling me Ritsuka, the other main character, or some type of cutesy variation like Ritsy or his Sacrifice (another thing related to the show). He even wanted me to roleplay as Ritsuka in bed which is... really unsettling because Ritsuka is 12 years old (I told you the anime is fucked up. And yes, the characters are romantically involved in the anime too). He even bought me a cat ear headband so he could \"finally take my ears.\" For context, in the show people are born with random animal ears and tails. They are supposed to represent innocence and virginity. When the character finally has sex in this world they lose the animal parts. I'll admit the roleplay was kind of hot but... fuck I don't know.\n\nThen he started getting more obsessed with it. He grew out his blonde hair so it could be more like Soubi's. He bought every piece of clothing he could find to mimic all the ones he's seen Soubi wear in the show and books. He even bought a fake pair of glasses that looked like Soubi's. He began taking up art like Soubi does (which he's fucking awful at by the way). He even wants to get a tattoo of the word \"LOVELESS\" across his upper chest like Soubi has carved and scared into his. I'm SO glad he wants a tattoo but I'm scared it's going to evolve into him taking a knife and carving it into his chest like Soubi did. I'm no longer dating my boyfriend. I'm 100% dating Soubi in terms of looks and personality and I can't stand it. It's absolutely destroying me little by little each day. I don't want to leave but, fuck, I just want my boyfriend back.\n\nProblem is... I feel like a selfish asshole. He's so much happier and this change seems to be less obsessive and more healthy in nature. He's a lot more outgoing now, he goes to social events, charity events, he has more friends, has been excelling at work and he's even being considered for a promotion, he's been losing weight and toning up, eating better... I don't know what to do. I don't want to ask him to change for my sake but all seems so crazy and unhealthy and yet I'm the one falling apart while he's living life without a care in the world.\n\nWhen I did make the post on r/relationships people suggested he may be associating this with trauma he my have had in his childhood and he may be using this fictionkin thing to try and move past it in some way. Others suggested that this is dangerous and could lead to a much more dangerous path. Some also suggested I should try and convince him to seek therapy which I don't know how I'd do it since he believes he is truly fine and happy. Someone else suggested maybe he needs to just ride it out and it's a face. However because it was removed so quickly I wasn't able to get a general consensus on what might be best. I just feel like an enabler now since I didn't bat an eye.\n\nWhat do I do, Reddit? I miss my boyfriend. \n\ntl;dr My boyfriend thinks he is the reincarnation of an anime character and has changed completely to the point he is this anime character and has been using it to improve his life significantly while I'm falling apart because I miss the man I fell in love with.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2071093, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [24M] boyfriend [27M] has turned into an anime character and I'm not sure what to do anymore.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569940417, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbcfke/my_24m_boyfriend_27m_has_turned_into_an_anime/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwaway163728", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4p63bk1d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569853865, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbce2o/wife32f_said_shes_asexual_and_now_taking_it_back/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbce2o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 305, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbce2o/wife32f_said_shes_asexual_and_now_taking_it_back/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1569853872, "score": 343, "selftext": "Been together for 7 years, mostly pretty good, except the last few months.

She was honest with me early on and told me the history they had together, even if it was only one night. I trusted her and said I was ok with it.\n\nFast forward to last Friday, I take a trip to Chicago for the weekend to visit family. She calls me on day 2 and tells me she has some bad news, and not to freak out. She makes me wait until I get back home to break the news. Apparently her, John and a female friend were hanging out drinking in her room like they have done plenty of times. When they all layed down to take a nap, this fucking guy pulls his dick out and moves my girl's hand onto it. She then gives him a lazy, half-asleep handjob.

I feel like all trust is out the window now.\n\nShould I end things? She seems perfect for me and she seems like she is VERY upset with herself.

(First time poster.)\n\nWe have been together 8 years, and I've become increasingly unhappy. We have what I would describe as a mother-son dynamic, where I do all his cooking/cleaning/finances/shopping/laundry and he mostly plays video games, makes messes, and gets baked. There has been no sex for over a year. I feel like I'm always nagging a teenage boy who is rolling his eyes at me. (I know this is completely stupid, but I had a really bad marriage before and just felt happy to be with a non-abusive person when we met...) Anyway this dynamic is NOT SEXY. When we first got together everything was great... when I confront him and try to have a serious talk he gets super defensive and shuts down. And I end up apologizing so we can get back to normal. \n\nAnyway. He recently went away for 3 months for a job, and I was really hoping this could be a \"reset\" for us and things would be fresh when he came home. He's been home for 2 weeks and I think it's worse than ever... I have a full time job and a part time job, which makes it even more frustrating that he won't lift a finger to do house work during this period of unemployment. He says he is taking a well-deserved break... I nag him. He resents me. \n\nAnyway. The crackers. \n\nI got up this morning to the empty giant cardboard box of my Mary's Crackers resting on top of the blue bin. (Cardboard doesn't go there.) Also there is an understanding that these are \"my\" crackers, and he doesn't even like them. I jokingly commented to him, as he lazes in bed, that he is in trouble for eating my crackers. He said \"there's still some in the cupboard.\" Then I went to the cupboard to see what kind of crackers I\u2019m left with for the week, and there is a torn open plastic bag with about 11 crackers in it just sitting on top of the other stuff. Like he obviously stuffed himself with crackers and then biffed the OPEN BAG into the cupboard without putting a clip or a twist tie on it or ANYTHING! So I had to find a ziploc bag, and put them in there with rage-shaking hands\u2026\n\nI am actually shaking and having a hard time breathing. He is still in bed. I'm going to go to the gym right now - it's all I can think of to do because I literally can't stay in this apartment right now. I feel like I've been psychologically broken by crackers. (He does this kind of stuff a lot... I feel like this is the last straw.)\n\nTo be clear, this guy is very funny, sweet, and handsome. He works a hard job, with long hours (when he works). I love him. But our dynamic is messed up, and I often wish I had someone to take care of me a little bit in return... I am burnt out. We have a nice apartment and a cat together... and 8 years is a long time. Please advise. Am I being psychotic? I need some outside perspective please. \n\nTLDR long term boyfriend ate my crackers.
