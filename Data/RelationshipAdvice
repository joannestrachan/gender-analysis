Lately we started hanging out alone more and he\u2019s just amazing. Cute, smart and pretty shy but I like it. Not sure if he feels the same way about me but he always wants to hang out so I hope that\u2019s a good sign. I only have one problem....\n\nMy \u2018condition\u2019 (couldn\u2019t think of a more fitting word) is that I sneeze when I\u2019m aroused. Yes, really. Whenever I have a sexual thought or get turned on I get these sneezing fits. I use nasal sprays to keep things under control. \n\nAnyway, whenever I hang out with this guy I start sneezing as soon as I see him. At the beginning I told him that it\u2019s just a cold (it wasn\u2019t) and that I\u2019m very sensitive during cold seasons (I\u2019m not). I kept lying about it and he probably thought I\u2019m just a sickly person. For a while he even encouraged me to go to the doc but I told him that it\u2019s not a serious problem. \n\nThe problem is that he\u2019s slowly putting the pieces together but he\u2019s taking it the wrong way. He pointed out that I only sneeze when I\u2019m around him, not others. For example one time he saw me talk to a friend and I was fine, when I came up to him and we hugged I sneezed. He joked that I\u2019m obviously allergic to him and that I should just be honest if I can\u2019t stand him. \n\n\nSo should I tell him the truth or would it be too creepy? At this point we\u2019re pretty comfortable around each other but I don\u2019t wanna make things weird. Would it freak him out? \n\n**TL;DR I sneeze when I\u2019m physically aroused.

I called a cop to come stand outside while I got my things. He teared up a bit, and then asked why we couldn't talk about it. We have talked about it so many times. He told me it was embarrassing that I called the cops. When I was finished packing, I asked him for my spare car key and he said \"I don't have my keys with me. You didn't warn me you were calling the cops. If I'm allowed inside I can go get them.\" \\*Eye Roll.\\*  He truly did not understand why I called the cops. I never thought he would lay a hand on me, but I didn't want to risk anything. I was worried he'd try to keep me there to talk, or let the air out of my tires again.\n\nHe then told me he had been thinking about suicide. Maybe he said it to make me feel bad, but I told him to seek therapy because I want him to be happy and figure out his issues. He told me he listed out all of our issues and that it was less than 10 things. I'm not sure how that was supposed to make me feel better.\n\nI am back at my mom's and he is currently packing his things and going to Florida to visit his family. I have been in contact with his brother since I found out about the coke and he has been very supportive of my decision, along with my sister and a close friend of mine.\n\nThank you, redditors, for helping me taking the leap. I am extremely sad, but not regretful of my decision. I would've loved to work things out, but realistically it is just not possible. I cannot change the hurt he caused me. I cannot convince him to be honest with me or himself. I am ultimately enabling him to treat me like shit by staying in this marriage, and I will not accept that for him or myself.

Also, this is a throwaway account and I was an idiot when writing my name and typed throwaway instead of throwra.\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for 3 months now, so it's pretty new. So far everything is going well except this tiny little detail. He has this teddy bear, let's name him Teddy. Teddy has always been a part of my boyfriend's life : he got him for his birth and when at around the age of 5 or 6 (or whatever age is the appropriate age to remove a teddy bear from a child) his parents tried taking Teddy away from him, he screamt and cried so loud without stopping they ended up giving up. So he kept Teddy with him his whole life. \n\nHe mentionned Teddy to me pretty early, about a week after us being together. He showed me pictures of him and I found it cute at first. He had plenty of pictures of him in different situations (him with a mug, him laying in bed, him studying...). I truly found it adorable since I thought it was just a joke really and didn't think that Teddy was such a big part of his life. The more we got to know eachother the more he started mentionning him. He'd often make jokes about him. When he had to come back to his flat, he'd say \"I have to come back Teddy is waiting for me\" and then later he'd text me \"ok I put Teddy to bed so now I might go to sleep as well i don't want to wake him up\". Again, a little weird but cute still. But he really started talking about him constantly, always linking what we were doing to him (\"Oh I wish Teddy was with us to see that\", \"Teddy doesn't really like people so I won't take him with me for this party\" etc...) . He'd send me selfies with him at least twice a week.\n\nHe also sometimes said weird stuff like whenever we watched a sex scene in a movie he'd say \"that's what me and Teddy do when we're alone\" or when i asked when he lost his virginity he answered \"oh I lost it with Teddy a few years ago\". They were jokes that made me uncomfortable. He always seemt to consider him as a baby/his son/his brother, so him being sexualised was extremely weird for me. I told him then that it was weird and he just laughed but I don't think he took me seriously.\n\nAbout a month ago, I told him I was okay with him bringing Teddy when he was staying around my flat. I could see it was making him sad to leave him, and also was very curious to finally see him in person (I can't go to my boyfriend's flat, there are rules that are strict, he can't invite anyone). So that day I drove to his flat and he went with all his stuff and Teddy. When he got in the car he pulled him out from his bag and had him give me a kiss on the cheek. When we drove, he opened the window and put Teddy out of the car (a bit like a dog would). He said it was rare for Teddy to travel like that and he could feel that he was happy. Teddy smells a lot, my boyfriend hasn't washed him in 12 YEARS. For the rest of the car drive, he hugged him and gave him kisses.\n\nHe has weird \"twitch\" where he just compulsively pats the back of Teddy (it makes a weird sound because Teddy used to be able to play music when you pressed his belly). He always rubs Teddy's clothes inbetween his fingers (you can guess that Teddy is in a pretty bad state, he used to be red and now he's just grey). When we're together in bed, he always puts Teddy's mouth on my mouth and I always avoid it as I find it disgusting (and I told him that I hate it but he doesn't listen). He always tries to have Teddy touch my boobs or my arse. When we make love, I often end up finding him inbetween us and every time I throw him away my bf says \"oh no he likes to watch\" in a joking way. He often mentions us having a threesome with Teddy, him (Teddy) being great at licking, and them always doing kinky stuff together.\n\nNow I'm not an idiot. I know communication is important. I tried talking to him so many times. Sometimes in a joking way too so he doesn't feel attacked (like once, I asked who would he choose if he had to choose between me and Teddy, he said Teddy), but also so many times in a serious way (I told him I didn't like when he was rubbing Teddy on my face and body, I told him I found his relationship with him way too intense and weird) but every time he didn't take it seriously, made jokes, and never truly told me what he thought. I should mention that he is like that for any serious conversation, all he does is make awkward jokes and he never tells me how he feels (he said I love you first because he was drunk).\n\nThis is becoming hard to handle. I have been away from him for two weeks and was kind of relieved I wouldn't see Teddy anymore, but all he did was send pictures, and whenever I asked him \"what are you doing\" or \"what did you do today\" is answer was \"playing with Teddy\". Today he told me I was perfect, which was a first and I sure didn't expect that (he doesn't give a lot of compliment). When he said that I said \"really ?\" and his reply was \"actually no, Teddy is perfect, you come way after him\". I just gave up and didn't reply.\n\nI have 3 questions. 1) Am I overreacting, am I the one not being tolerant enough, am I some boring girlfriend who can't welcome some childishness in her couple ? 2) What should I do, should I let him live his life with Teddy, should I ask him to make a real choice, should I ask him to just stop the sexual jokes... Like, who am I to ask such things I don't know ? Is it my place to tell him to stop being so weird with his teddy bear ? And 3) How do I get him to finally talk to me and take me seriously ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR : my bf has a weird relationship with his teddy bear, he considers him as a baby/a son but still makes very sexual jokes about him, often involving me by having him touch my body and it's making uncomfortable, what can I do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [21F] boyfriend's [23M] relationship with his teddybear is making me uncomfortable", "total_awards_received": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejyfv1/my_21f_boyfriends_23m_relationship_with_his/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "moodytuxx79", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_47y7w1m8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578153286, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "edited": 1578168307, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy8zh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 96, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1578192645, "score": 177, "selftext": "My husband has 3 older sisters and 2 younger sisters, but they are all very close in age. He is the only guy. \n\nI\u2019ve always sensed his sisters don\u2019t like me, but they\u2019re very fake and passive aggressive about it. They\u2019ll act all nice when they\u2019re alone with me, but when they all come together they try to purposely exclude me and will go as far as either completely ignoring my husband when he\u2019s with me, or trying to pull him away from me at their family gatherings so that I am left alone. \n\nHis mom is a saint and is the only reason why I would still even consider showing up at any of their little get togethers, but after the one last night I doubt I ever will again. In short, they were all very rude the whole night, again being very passive aggressive and just straight up ignoring both my husband and I. I don\u2019t know why honestly. I\u2019m very shy so I\u2019ve never been super open with them or anything, but I\u2019ve always been polite to them and open to getting to know them. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve pretty much decided I want nothing to do with the sisters anymore. I know this hurts my husband because he\u2019s very family oriented and grew up close with a few of them, but I also know that if it comes down to it, if I say I want nothing do with them, he won\u2019t want to either because even he sees how rude they\u2019ve been to me on multiple occasions, for absolutely no reason. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just having trouble trying to figure out where to draw the line between no longer showing up to their family gatherings at all and trying to decide which ones are important for me to just stick out for the sake of my MIL since she is very dear to my husband and I. \n\nI\u2019m also currently pregnant, and I know my MIL and my mom are planning a \u201csurprise\u201d baby shower for me together. Obviously his sisters will be involved, but I\u2019m seriously reconsidering even having a baby shower because I don\u2019t want them to be apart of it, I do not want them there, and I do not want them to be apart of our baby\u2019s life. \n\nI know a lot of people will try to say im just hormonal and overreacting, because apparently that\u2019s the first thing everyone thinks as soon as someone even mentions being pregnant, but rest assured that i am being very vague here.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405340, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I want nothing to do with my husbands 5 sisters anymore", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "banned_by": "moderators", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578153168, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy854", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": true, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 187, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1578192588, "score": 171, "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Girlfriend attempted to cheat, got raped in the process, and now is looking to me for emotional support?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "Throwawayveeplalw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5azwkae5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578152711, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy4u9/update_i_told_my_ex_girlfriends_daughter_that_im/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy4u9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "/r/all", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": true, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 242, "num_crossposts": 1, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy4u9/update_i_told_my_ex_girlfriends_daughter_that_im/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1578192348, "score": 6835, "selftext": "Link to original thread - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/ega8eq/i_told_my_ex_girlfriends_daughter_that_im_not_her/\n\nCredit to /u/blackadar1 top comment, I sent that to my ex.

I never told the kids or ever let them see us fighting, as far as they knew we were happy, we just liked to pick on each other every now and again, at least that's how we made it seem in front of them. \n\nI have since moved on and am currently in a healthy and happy relationship with a man who goes out of his way to make sure my girls and I are happy. Earlier tonight my oldest messaged me on Facebook from their room to tell me that LT (my youngest) has been crying herself to sleep every night over this. I guess my oldest would calm her down and keep it secret because LT asked that but tonight was just too much. \n\nI went upstairs and LT was curled up pretending to be asleep but you could see the tears on her cheek. I told my oldest to leave the room so I could talk to LT. I asked her what was wrong and she said she missed her father, that she couldn't remember what he looked like. Side note: He doesn't see them that often, not because I keep them from him but because he lives an hour away and doesn't like to make the drive down here to see them. He can't have the kids at his house due to its condition. He was down this last weekend though due to the holidays and our oldest daughter's bday... I reminded her that she had just seen him over the weekend but she was still upset. She then asked why her father and I divorced. From day 1 I told her that while her dad and I still love each other, we agreed we are better friends than we are a couple. I did not go into details regarding the abuse or how he would neglect them to play on a computer etc. She didn't quite understand so I tried to put it in a way she would by using a friend of hers. They get along but they aren't best friends, same with her dad and I. She then asked about a song I used to sing to her 'You are my Sunshine' and asked if I would sing it to her. I pulled her into my lap and rocked her while I sang until she started to fall asleep then I put her in bed. \n\nMy question for everyone is, how can I help with this? She already sees a councilor, but I think she's hiding a lot of feelings. I lied a little to her, her dad and I aren't exactly friends. I do try to keep in touch with him as we agreed on shared parenting. I tried to call him so she could speak with him but he wouldn't answer. I just told her he must be sleeping (he's not, he works night shift so right now is his daytime) I spoke with my guy about it and he doesn't know what to do either. Should I arrange for him to spend some quality time with the girls or would that make it worse on her and make her miss her father more? I don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR- Youngest is upset that her father and I divorced a year ago and cries herself to sleep each night. Already seeing a therapist but I'm thinking she may be hiding feelings.

She said that the dealbreaker was her having a kid, and I said I wanted to have a biological child of my own so it might have to be. She changed almost instantly and started swearing, saying \"this isn't fucking happening\", \"What the fuck, do you know who I am? I don't give second chances.\", and said she would take our 2 cats and all of her belongings (which  I said yes to and threw her off as she was expecting me to fight that), then berated me for wanting to bring a child into the world when there are already so many and how dare I force a woman to go through childbirth. She said I might not even be able to have kids because of my low testosterone (which is true, but irrelevant and a **very** low blow), tried to tell me how expensive kids are (which I already know) then pivoted and said she was open to adoption/surrogacy/fostering despite what she'd just said and her consistency the past 2 years in not wanting kids (and just a few minutes before she'd said that our parenting styles with the cats were so different that having a kid would probably tear us apart). \n\nAll of this ended with her saying that if I truly loved her I would fix this, and that I wasn't breaking up with her and she'd be back Sunday to \"discuss this further.\" before walking out and saying that she couldn't believe I'd brought this up and that she'd been looking forward to one of the long goodnight texts I used to send before we lived together.\n\nSo. I feel like I **probably** made the correct decision, given some of the things she said and how she reacted/twisted things. She also tried to make me out as a bad person by saying \"How dare you say that I either have to have your baby or break up with you.\" Which... I guess if you want to twist things around to make me look bad that's the way to do it. I didn't **want** to break up with her, but given her positions and my wants I don't see another way around it. I tried to be as cordial and calm as I could be the whole time. I had to ask her to stop firmly when she went into the low testosterone issue, but aside from that I mostly stuck to apologizing and trying to deal with her changing her stance/position every few minutes.\n\nHere's my questions this time:\n\n1. I've been in an abusive relationship before, and the phrase \"If you truly love me you'll fix this.\" sounds dangerously close to some of the things my ex used to say. Is that actually as abusive as I feel it is, or am I letting my past experiences color my perception of this interaction too much?\n2. I've basically made up my mind, especially with how she treated me and some of the things she said today. Yes, I know I hurt her (and dear god did I feel horrible about that), but she basically spent the better part of an hour berating me for wanting to have a child and tried very hard to spin me as a bad person/make me feel bad. That alone is enough in my books to merit the end of our relationship. That being said, I could use some advice on how to handle the \"continuation\" of this conversation come Sunday. I know she's going to go home and research the cost of a kid, the cost of adoption/fostering/surrogacy, etc to try and throw in my face to argue me into agreeing with her.\n\nThanks again for all the advice from last time. I appreciated it, and I honestly do feel like I made the right choice.

Our marriage has some minor issues, but more like \"slowly dying\" issues and not domestic violence issues. I've never posted here before and never thought something like this would happen to me. This incident occurred on New Year's Eve. \n\nWe were drinking and having a good time playing some card games and waiting for midnight with a group of friends. One of the guys made an off-color joke about domestic violence, to which one of the girls got (rightfully) offended because she had been a victim of DV in the past. He didn't mean anything by it and apologized, and we seemed to be moving on.\n\nSuddenly my wife blurts out: \"Jim slapped me once\". I looked at her expecting to hear some kind of joke, but she had a serious look on her face. Everyone was kind of puzzled, but then she told this story about how when we were first married that we got into a big fight and I supposedly lost my temper and slapped her in the face.\n\nThis never happened. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a violent person. I've never hit anyone. I've never even been in a fight in school. I'm the youngest and smallest of four brothers and would routinely get my ass kicked by them, so reacting violently to situations was never my thing. I've never even raised my voice at my wife, which is something she's always hated about me because she feels like I don't show emotion.\n\nMy friends (male and female) immediately jumped to my defense and said they didn't believe her. Even her own best friend who's known me as long as we've been married didn't seem to believe her.\n\nAt this point my wife gets upset at the fact that no one believes her and starts to cry. She then starts trying to justify the situation and said that she was the one who was hitting me first and that I responded by slapping her back. The first part is true as she did attack me physically several times  in the early years, but I thought we worked through that and nothing like it has happened in a long time. However, again, I NEVER struck her back.\n\nOne of our friends started talking about false memories and how sometimes we remember things differently as a kind of way to change the conversation. Naturally the party took a weird turn after that and everyone left right after midnight.\n\nThings between my wife and I have been tense. I tried to sit her down and talk to her about it, but she still insists that it happened and that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nThis is the first and only time she's made an accusation like this, and of course she does it in front of other people, including an actual DV victim. How should I approach this? Is it even possible to help her realize that it never happened? Is this a sign of something deeper, like maybe her setting herself up for divorce? I don't think she's the type, but before the other day I didn't think she would be the type to accuse me of this bullshit either.\n\nObviously, I'm deeply offended by this and expect an apology, but I can't even move on to that side of things as long as she keeps insisting it happened. What the fuck am I supposed to do?\n\nTLDR Wife accused me of slapping her but I didn't", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2402682, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (33/M) wife (31/F) accused me of slapping her in front of a group of friends.

Fairly big company with a large office. I enjoy my work and get along with everyone there. There are a few older, more experienced people who are team leaders and managers but most of us are young/under 30s. Out of us babies it's about 70/30 girls to guys. I generally hang out with the guys more. I don't dislike the girls but we don't have much in common (they're all graduates from top ranked places which I'm not. They're all very girly and pretty which I'm not etc.). I get along with them well enough though and have them all on social media. \n\nThere's this one guy in the office who barely speaks to anyone. I'll call him Mark. He's actually quite a friendly guy (and not bad looking either!) but is very quiet. He works hard and actually stays in the office when we all go for lunch. Pretty much all of the younger set make fun of him except me (and I do tell the guys to chill out with it), but the managers really like him because of how dedicated he is. \n\nWe were back at work yesterday, and Mark stepped out for something. One of my colleagues, Amanda, sneaked over to his desk for some reason. She looked into his computer, laughed and took a pic. \n\nI follow her on instagram and she put on her story a picture of Mark's google searches. It included things like ''How to get a girlfriend'', ''Places to meet women'', ''How to talk to women'', ''Places to meet new friends'', etc. Amanda wrote ''Imagine working with people like this #30yearoldvirgin.'' I felt really bad for Mark since he isn't a bad guy at all. \n\nWhen he came back I showed him the story and told him we should report her. We did. We spoke to the manager and she said she would deal with it. She called Amanda into the office. Don't know what she said but when Amanda stepped out she was close to tears. She sat down and got on with her work. \n\nIn the evening I was at home when I started getting DMs from some of the other girls in the office, calling me a ''snitch'' and saying they would ''ruin me'' if anything Amanda gets any kind of serious punishment (which I don't think she will). \n\nI'm worried about this situation. While I don't think anything will happen to Amanda, it won't be a fun place to work with her and her friends there.

Next dinner would be her treat, etc.\n\nHowever, about a year into the relationship, she was laid off from her job, so I picked up the slack and started paying for about 90% of our outings.  This went on for several months.\n\nFinally, she found a (rather high paying) job and has been gainfully employed for about 4 months now, making more money than I do.  However, whenever we go out, she gets alligator arms when the bill comes, and I sheepishly end up just paying it.  Instead of going back to sharing expenses like it was when we first dated, it was now \"assumed\" I would pay for everything.\n\nI've communicated to her about this and she agreed to start contributing.  I said I don't mind paying, but if I'm expected to pay for everything, its severely going to limit how often we are able to go out.  Otherwise, if she wants to go out as often as she does, I expect her to foot the bill sometimes.  She agreed....or so I thought.\n\nFast forward to NYE planning....I don't like going out.  Its crowded, overpriced, etc.  Not my scene.  However, she wants to go to a fancy restaurant with a couple of her friends (another couple).  I agree to go out, but ask that she at least split the bill with me.  She says Yes.\n\nThe dinner goes great and the bill comes.  She hesitates waiting for me to reach for the bill, but I don't.  Instead, I put cash on the table for my half (plus tip).  She gives me the stink eye, and angrily digs in her purse for her credit card.  The rest of NYE was spent with her sulking and ignoring me.\n\nThe following day, we are semi-fighting/re-hashing what happened the night prior, with it culminating in her texting \"Why the FUCK am I going dutch with my boyfriend of 2 years?\"\n\nI've admittedly been out of the dating scene for awhile, after being married for 15 years prior...is it still the expectation that the man pay for everything?  I had (maybe incorrectly) assumed the dating scene was more equal these days.  I feel taken advantage of when I am expected to foot the bill every time....like I'm viewed as a walking ATM.  How can I get her to understand my point of view?  I've spoken with her several times and it seems to go well....until the bill comes and she changes her tune.  \n\nTL;DR:  I (40M) helped to financially support my GF (42F) during her unemployment...paying for every night out.

But before that, let me say I\u2019m moving on now as a single parent and super happy with my decision to let go of this person! \n\nUpdate as of January 2020: Fianc\u00e9 is now my husband, but we only got married before I gave birth because in my country, an illegitimate child does not have full rights to own inherited property (sad, but true). We are only married legally but that\u2019s just about it. At least he agreed to this for our child.\n\n- Our child is now 6 months old and I am raising her with my family. \n- Since our child was born, he only saw her once, when she was 2 weeks old. I did not allow any more visits. Why? He\u2019s still toxic to be with. When he went to see our child, he even asked me to pay for his overnight hotel stay since he wanted to come with me on our baby\u2019s checkup the following day. Being the enabler that I am, I gave in and paid for it (now I know better). There was zero remorse, no \u201cthank you\u201d for single-handedly handling everything to the best I can, and I only received a list of grudges and another list of things he did right for me. I. Was. Just. So. Shocked witnessing how the person I loved turn into someone I barely know.\n- He is still in a relationship with the other party, but occasionally emails me that he regrets what he\u2019s done and wants to go back. I really don\u2019t get the point of this.\n- According to his sister, his new gf and her family are totally financially dependent on him and this is taking a toll on him. So his parents bought him a plane ticket back to his home country and he\u2019s living with them now because he can barely survive in our country having to support his new gf\u2019s family (their child together, the gf\u2019s child, gf\u2019s siblings, and grandmother). He just sends monthly support to his child with her.\n- I am soooo happy I\u2019m out of this relationship. At first I thought I couldn\u2019t handle the abandonment, but with time, I am even more thankful that my child and I were saved from being hooked further into this kind of man who is not even worthy of being called a father. \n\nThank you so much for all the support and your messages. These helped me gain perspective and be more firm at a time when I was so vulnerable. Given the circumstances around my pregnancy, I knew in my heart no amount of pain, betrayal or disrespect could stop me from being a mother. It\u2019s awesome to be a parent when you\u2019re so ready to have a child :)\n\nTL;DR: Fianc\u00e9 left me when I was 4 weeks pregnant with our first child. Turns out, he got another girl pregnant and our baby is only 5 days older than theirs. They lived in our conjugal home while I was away for a short work trip. I shared my story on Reddit 7 mos ago, thinking I couldn\u2019t handle this. But 7 mos on, I\u2019m continuing my journey as a solo parent and haven\u2019t looked back.

They were all home for Christmas and after conversations with my older two children, I have concerns about my youngest (\"Mary\"). Mary is in her second year of University, which is located about 90 minutes away from our house. She lived on campus her first year and is now renting a house with friends off-campus. \n\nIt started when my oldest made an offhand comment when Mary arrived home for her Christmas break to the effect of \"at least I won't be getting drunk snaps at 3 a.m. for a few weeks...\" I'm not up on snapchat, so later I asked her what she meant and she told me that Mary had been doing a lot of partying this semester and she had a habit of sending messages when she'd been out. Her and Mary are pretty close, so I pried a bit further and she told me that Mary was probably going out 3-4 times per week or more, and that she had also done some recreational drugs too - pot (which is legal here) and, she thought, cocaine (which is not, obviously). I asked if she did these things when she was that age and she said she wasn't cool enough to get invited to those kinds of parties (and I believe her - a mother knows her kids, okay!). \n\nMy son is at the same University but in his last year. I asked him offhand whether he saw that Mary went out a lot or anything and he more or less reacted as though he thought I already knew. He thought she went out most nights and that he thought she needed to watch her drinking because it could get her in dangerous spots. \n\nThis new information has changed my thoughts on a few things I'd noticed already. First, the grades that Mary has so far from her first semester are down a fair bit from her first year. She's still waiting on two exam results. Mary had said that the courses were just harder in second year, which I had thought reasonable at the time. Second, she had stayed at school over thanksgiving to work on a 'project', which I had thought a bit odd at the time but decided not to press. Third, she was around for New Years and while she was mostly off with her own friends in the basement, I did notice that she drank a lot that night.\n\nNow, Mary is an adult, and my husband and I have always tried to give our children their own autonomy and responsibilities. I was a pretty straight-laced kid, as was my husband, so I don't have perspective on what is 'normal' teenager rebellion/college fun or more serious. At the same time, I find this behaviour concerning, she's still young, and I'm still her mom.
