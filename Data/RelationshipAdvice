Lately we started hanging out alone more and he\u2019s just amazing. Cute, smart and pretty shy but I like it. Not sure if he feels the same way about me but he always wants to hang out so I hope that\u2019s a good sign. I only have one problem....\n\nMy \u2018condition\u2019 (couldn\u2019t think of a more fitting word) is that I sneeze when I\u2019m aroused. Yes, really. Whenever I have a sexual thought or get turned on I get these sneezing fits. I use nasal sprays to keep things under control. \n\nAnyway, whenever I hang out with this guy I start sneezing as soon as I see him. At the beginning I told him that it\u2019s just a cold (it wasn\u2019t) and that I\u2019m very sensitive during cold seasons (I\u2019m not). I kept lying about it and he probably thought I\u2019m just a sickly person. For a while he even encouraged me to go to the doc but I told him that it\u2019s not a serious problem. \n\nThe problem is that he\u2019s slowly putting the pieces together but he\u2019s taking it the wrong way. He pointed out that I only sneeze when I\u2019m around him, not others. For example one time he saw me talk to a friend and I was fine, when I came up to him and we hugged I sneezed. He joked that I\u2019m obviously allergic to him and that I should just be honest if I can\u2019t stand him. \n\n\nSo should I tell him the truth or would it be too creepy? At this point we\u2019re pretty comfortable around each other but I don\u2019t wanna make things weird. Would it freak him out? \n\n**TL;DR I sneeze when I\u2019m physically aroused.

I called a cop to come stand outside while I got my things. He teared up a bit, and then asked why we couldn't talk about it. We have talked about it so many times. He told me it was embarrassing that I called the cops. When I was finished packing, I asked him for my spare car key and he said \"I don't have my keys with me. You didn't warn me you were calling the cops. If I'm allowed inside I can go get them.\" \\*Eye Roll.\\*  He truly did not understand why I called the cops. I never thought he would lay a hand on me, but I didn't want to risk anything. I was worried he'd try to keep me there to talk, or let the air out of my tires again.\n\nHe then told me he had been thinking about suicide. Maybe he said it to make me feel bad, but I told him to seek therapy because I want him to be happy and figure out his issues. He told me he listed out all of our issues and that it was less than 10 things. I'm not sure how that was supposed to make me feel better.\n\nI am back at my mom's and he is currently packing his things and going to Florida to visit his family. I have been in contact with his brother since I found out about the coke and he has been very supportive of my decision, along with my sister and a close friend of mine.\n\nThank you, redditors, for helping me taking the leap. I am extremely sad, but not regretful of my decision. I would've loved to work things out, but realistically it is just not possible. I cannot change the hurt he caused me. I cannot convince him to be honest with me or himself. I am ultimately enabling him to treat me like shit by staying in this marriage, and I will not accept that for him or myself.

Also, this is a throwaway account and I was an idiot when writing my name and typed throwaway instead of throwra.\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for 3 months now, so it's pretty new. So far everything is going well except this tiny little detail. He has this teddy bear, let's name him Teddy. Teddy has always been a part of my boyfriend's life : he got him for his birth and when at around the age of 5 or 6 (or whatever age is the appropriate age to remove a teddy bear from a child) his parents tried taking Teddy away from him, he screamt and cried so loud without stopping they ended up giving up. So he kept Teddy with him his whole life. \n\nHe mentionned Teddy to me pretty early, about a week after us being together. He showed me pictures of him and I found it cute at first. He had plenty of pictures of him in different situations (him with a mug, him laying in bed, him studying...). I truly found it adorable since I thought it was just a joke really and didn't think that Teddy was such a big part of his life. The more we got to know eachother the more he started mentionning him. He'd often make jokes about him. When he had to come back to his flat, he'd say \"I have to come back Teddy is waiting for me\" and then later he'd text me \"ok I put Teddy to bed so now I might go to sleep as well i don't want to wake him up\". Again, a little weird but cute still. But he really started talking about him constantly, always linking what we were doing to him (\"Oh I wish Teddy was with us to see that\", \"Teddy doesn't really like people so I won't take him with me for this party\" etc...) . He'd send me selfies with him at least twice a week.\n\nHe also sometimes said weird stuff like whenever we watched a sex scene in a movie he'd say \"that's what me and Teddy do when we're alone\" or when i asked when he lost his virginity he answered \"oh I lost it with Teddy a few years ago\". They were jokes that made me uncomfortable. He always seemt to consider him as a baby/his son/his brother, so him being sexualised was extremely weird for me. I told him then that it was weird and he just laughed but I don't think he took me seriously.\n\nAbout a month ago, I told him I was okay with him bringing Teddy when he was staying around my flat. I could see it was making him sad to leave him, and also was very curious to finally see him in person (I can't go to my boyfriend's flat, there are rules that are strict, he can't invite anyone). So that day I drove to his flat and he went with all his stuff and Teddy. When he got in the car he pulled him out from his bag and had him give me a kiss on the cheek. When we drove, he opened the window and put Teddy out of the car (a bit like a dog would). He said it was rare for Teddy to travel like that and he could feel that he was happy. Teddy smells a lot, my boyfriend hasn't washed him in 12 YEARS. For the rest of the car drive, he hugged him and gave him kisses.\n\nHe has weird \"twitch\" where he just compulsively pats the back of Teddy (it makes a weird sound because Teddy used to be able to play music when you pressed his belly). He always rubs Teddy's clothes inbetween his fingers (you can guess that Teddy is in a pretty bad state, he used to be red and now he's just grey). When we're together in bed, he always puts Teddy's mouth on my mouth and I always avoid it as I find it disgusting (and I told him that I hate it but he doesn't listen). He always tries to have Teddy touch my boobs or my arse. When we make love, I often end up finding him inbetween us and every time I throw him away my bf says \"oh no he likes to watch\" in a joking way. He often mentions us having a threesome with Teddy, him (Teddy) being great at licking, and them always doing kinky stuff together.\n\nNow I'm not an idiot. I know communication is important. I tried talking to him so many times. Sometimes in a joking way too so he doesn't feel attacked (like once, I asked who would he choose if he had to choose between me and Teddy, he said Teddy), but also so many times in a serious way (I told him I didn't like when he was rubbing Teddy on my face and body, I told him I found his relationship with him way too intense and weird) but every time he didn't take it seriously, made jokes, and never truly told me what he thought. I should mention that he is like that for any serious conversation, all he does is make awkward jokes and he never tells me how he feels (he said I love you first because he was drunk).\n\nThis is becoming hard to handle. I have been away from him for two weeks and was kind of relieved I wouldn't see Teddy anymore, but all he did was send pictures, and whenever I asked him \"what are you doing\" or \"what did you do today\" is answer was \"playing with Teddy\". Today he told me I was perfect, which was a first and I sure didn't expect that (he doesn't give a lot of compliment). When he said that I said \"really ?\" and his reply was \"actually no, Teddy is perfect, you come way after him\". I just gave up and didn't reply.\n\nI have 3 questions. 1) Am I overreacting, am I the one not being tolerant enough, am I some boring girlfriend who can't welcome some childishness in her couple ? 2) What should I do, should I let him live his life with Teddy, should I ask him to make a real choice, should I ask him to just stop the sexual jokes... Like, who am I to ask such things I don't know ? Is it my place to tell him to stop being so weird with his teddy bear ? And 3) How do I get him to finally talk to me and take me seriously ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR : my bf has a weird relationship with his teddy bear, he considers him as a baby/a son but still makes very sexual jokes about him, often involving me by having him touch my body and it's making uncomfortable, what can I do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My [21F] boyfriend's [23M] relationship with his teddybear is making me uncomfortable", "total_awards_received": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejyfv1/my_21f_boyfriends_23m_relationship_with_his/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "moodytuxx79", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_47y7w1m8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578153286, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "edited": 1578168307, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy8zh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 96, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1578192645, "score": 177, "selftext": "My husband has 3 older sisters and 2 younger sisters, but they are all very close in age. He is the only guy. \n\nI\u2019ve always sensed his sisters don\u2019t like me, but they\u2019re very fake and passive aggressive about it. They\u2019ll act all nice when they\u2019re alone with me, but when they all come together they try to purposely exclude me and will go as far as either completely ignoring my husband when he\u2019s with me, or trying to pull him away from me at their family gatherings so that I am left alone. \n\nHis mom is a saint and is the only reason why I would still even consider showing up at any of their little get togethers, but after the one last night I doubt I ever will again. In short, they were all very rude the whole night, again being very passive aggressive and just straight up ignoring both my husband and I. I don\u2019t know why honestly. I\u2019m very shy so I\u2019ve never been super open with them or anything, but I\u2019ve always been polite to them and open to getting to know them. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve pretty much decided I want nothing to do with the sisters anymore. I know this hurts my husband because he\u2019s very family oriented and grew up close with a few of them, but I also know that if it comes down to it, if I say I want nothing do with them, he won\u2019t want to either because even he sees how rude they\u2019ve been to me on multiple occasions, for absolutely no reason. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just having trouble trying to figure out where to draw the line between no longer showing up to their family gatherings at all and trying to decide which ones are important for me to just stick out for the sake of my MIL since she is very dear to my husband and I. \n\nI\u2019m also currently pregnant, and I know my MIL and my mom are planning a \u201csurprise\u201d baby shower for me together. Obviously his sisters will be involved, but I\u2019m seriously reconsidering even having a baby shower because I don\u2019t want them to be apart of it, I do not want them there, and I do not want them to be apart of our baby\u2019s life. \n\nI know a lot of people will try to say im just hormonal and overreacting, because apparently that\u2019s the first thing everyone thinks as soon as someone even mentions being pregnant, but rest assured that i am being very vague here.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405340, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I want nothing to do with my husbands 5 sisters anymore", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy8zh/i_want_nothing_to_do_with_my_husbands_5_sisters/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "banned_by": "moderators", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578153168, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejy854", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": true, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 187, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1578192588, "score": 171, "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 2405337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Girlfriend attempted to cheat, got raped in the process, and now is looking to me for emotional support?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejy854/girlfriend_attempted_to_cheat_got_raped_in_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
