I'm going to start this off with the disclaimer that I am a size zero, 105lbs indie model. Gonna get downvoted to shit, but whatever. \n\nWhenever I see posts like this, I just think \"world's smallest violin.\" Body shaming anyone sucks, but thin women receive far more positive messages and attention about their bodies than fat women, who usually receive only negative messages about their bodies. To argue that the their struggle is comparable is just wrong and frankly pisses me off. Here's why:\n\nWhen I see these sort of complaints by thin women about being called anorexics and being made to feel bad because of HAES, it reminds me of all the men who are like, \"my struggle as a white male is sooooo tough. Feminism hurts men.\" that they completely miss the issue that patriarchy hurts men and women, but their struggle is really insignificant compared to more marginalized groups. I feel like this is the same, placing women's appearances as their primary value of worth is bad for all of us, not just thin women or fat women. We shouldn't be arguing over who's body type is more  accepted because we should shun the concept of body acceptance all together. You should not need approval to love your body. \n\nI'm not saying thin women do not have their own struggles that are unique and important to them. Within my community, disordered eating is practically a job requirement. In fact, I am on hiatus right now because my weight and BFP got scary low, and I decided to gain some weight and be healthy for a while. My body fat percentage is 16%, and I'm too fat to work. (I did a lingerie show a couple months ago and was humiliated when I showed up and was the biggest girl there) Trust me when I say that I'm not ignorant of the difficulties and pressures faced by being thin. I'm just saying that comparing how difficult it is to be thin in a largely thin positive society to how it is to be fat in the same society comes off as being really ignorant. \n\nThat said, I am not a supporter of HAES. Merely someone who believes we should all be aware of how our experiences in life may differ from others, and practice empathy. And on one last note, if you're going to talk about how all skinny girls are not anorexic, maybe don't use a model who clearly has disordered eating. As an industry insider, and someone who struggles with disordered eating, I can say quite confidentially that I am not making an assumption.

Wrong. Wrong. As a note, before I get harangued for being some woman-hating basher, I grew up with all women. I have two daughters. My ultimate belief is in equality for all, which means I'm not a fan of capitalistic economic theory. But above all, I believe in honest and intellectual discourse based on facts and research.  \n\nFrom the White House report... the source of the source that feministing.com uses:\n\n&gt;The female-to-male-earnings ratio of 80 percent in 2009 is calculated using median weekly earnings of full-time male and female wage and salary workers, age 16 and older.\n\nFirst off, 80% and 75% are not the same number, but 75% sounds worse, so feel free to use it to emphasize supposed rampant inequality. Second, look up the definition of median; next, realize that they use this based on **ALL** full-time weekly wage salary workers. That's not breaking down for education, field of employ, etcetera... that's lumping everyone together. Not exactly an honest statistical portrait. \n\nYes, there are some instances where wage inequality still exists regardless of its illegality due to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Oh, and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.  Yes, there are still male dominated fields, as well as female dominated fields. Yes, males account for 9 out of 10 workplace deaths. Yes, men are more likely to take jobs that take them far from home for extended periods of time. Yes, women are likely to take lower earning jobs that offer more flexibility and allow for a balanced family and home life. \n\nThere are a multitude of social factors that contribute to this purported \"wage gap.\"\n\nIt's nice to see this disingenuous statistic still bandied about as an indictment of male oppression, a brash generalization of a very intricate and layered reality. In 2003, June O'Neill released [this report](http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/events/transatlantic/papers_2003/oneil.pdf) detailing the realities of the so-called wage gap. It's a bit more dry to read than feministing, but a lot more factual and honest. \n\nYes, women of equal experience and education should receive equal pay, and corporations and employers that do not do so are violating law at their own peril. Yes, if a woman wants to be a deep sea fisherman or work on an oil drilling rig in the middle of the ocean, go for it. If a man wants to work at a daycare part time or be a barista at Starbucks and be home in time to have supper ready for the wife and kids, more power to him. \n\nBut let's stop using disingenuous statistics to perpetuate a false reality.

I find it troubling that false accusations are the only cases that reddit ever seems to discuss when it comes to the topic of rape.\n\nYet you painted an entire thread on a board who's focus it is to deal with issues that affect MEN.  You come onto a men's board find issues men are talking about rationally, and you infer because of the up-vote count we are all a bunch of misogynists just because you don't agree with the proportion of attention that is being paid on one subject.\n\nEvery time any MRA wants to talk about anything concerning false rape allegations we need to amend it with \"I acknowledge rape happens, and it is bad\".  It's personally insulting that I need to state the obvious just because an ideology can't see past their own nose and because I am a man, and *presumed* by that ideology to hate women (why else would I be talking about such things?).\n\nNow if you wouldn't mind.

We got all that and more.  Hell, my personal view is considered too moderate and I have been banned from sub-sub MR boards on reddit... without even seeing them.\n\nAll of this is another issue, what bothers me is the /circljerk that is going on in your line of posts that is a one sided obscured and manipulated view of a false picture.\n\nIf you ignored the ratio of what (linked to, supported with sources, and credible) content we read, and instead observe how the board at large treats women , and even visiting feminists, you will see that WE ARE MORE POLITE AND RESPECTFUL to our complimentary gender than the rest of f-ing reddit.  Go see if you can find any flippant \"sammich\" jokes or \"get back in the kitchen\" jokes on the MR board.\n\nBecause our issues get so purposely distorted all of the time, the fact is we couldn't even afford to be rude to women if we wanted to.  The ONLY reason Mens Rights has been taking hold is because of pure hard observable and measurable facts and injustices.
