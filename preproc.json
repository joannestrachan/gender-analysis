I don't use them for emotional support. I don't tell them about my problems. I don't share much about me. I don't get too involved in their life.

Every time a thread like this pops up \"not like other girls\" types chime in that they *can't* make female friends because the women they see \"wear makeup\" or \"do their hair\" or something equally surface level. Maybe in movies that's supposed to say a lot about someone, but in real life the fact that a girl I know does or doesn't wear makeup tells me practically *nothing* about whether or not I'd get along with them. *Of course* if you buy into every teen movie you've ever seen you think you're \"not like other girls\", those girls are portrayed horribly and exceptionally one dimensionally. Practically no one in real life, not even the Kardashians or Paris Hilton types, are that devoid of depth. It's funny because usually they're coming at it from the angle of \"I'm not superficial and they are\", but *they're* the ones deciding who they will or won't be friends with based on their style. That's *wayyyyyyyyy* more superficial than slipping on some lipstick or curling your hair.And of course there's no real male equivalent for their guy friends. \"Oh he shaves his stubble daily, he's way too high maintenance we could never be friends\" Smart, capable, cool women style themselves in every single way imaginable. Michelle Obama is gorgeous, always wearing something stylish, does her makeup, etc. *And* has two ivy league degrees, among a laundry list of other accomplishments. Imagine avoiding her as a friend because she's \"too feminine\" or \"basic\" at first glance. I also hate the idea that comes along with all this, that you can only be successful friends with people who are *exactly like you.* That's so goddamn boring and not true. I'm 24 and have two friends in their 70s. I'm not very athletic and I have friends that might as well be olympic athletes. I have friends that are waaaaay less nerdy than me. We don't have everything in common but we all have chemistry, and I learn a lot from my friends that aren't the exact same \"type\" of girl or person as me.

I got burned particularly badly in my last relationship (which started with cool girl behavior and generally entailed a lot of doormat shit from me) and decided in the midst of that pain that I\u2019d rather die alone than take another trip around that carousel. So I started asking men for what I needed and expected from the get-go and realized that if dudes who couldn\u2019t meet my needs left or rejected me, that was a good thing. I ended up falling out with a couple of male friends because of this, but it was for the best. Eventually, I found a great, super-attuned guy who is very kind to me and takes my feelings into account when making decisions. :)"}, {"id": "fdbg3fd", "body": "I/PRP be/VBD definitely/RB a/DT \"/`` not/RB like/IN other/JJ girl/NNS \"/'' type/NN in/IN middle/NNP school/NNP &/CC high/NNP school/NNP ,/, but/CC never/RB to/TO be/VB the/DT cool/JJ girl/NN ./. \n I/PRP be/VBD not/RB generally/RB fond/JJ of/IN boy/NNS either/CC so/IN their/PRP$ attention/NN be/VBD not/RB my/PRP$ goal/NN ./. \n I/PRP be/VBD just/RB piss/VBN off/RP about/IN everything/NN ,/, intellectually/RB superior/JJ ,/, and/CC dress/VBN like/UH I/PRP want/VBD to/TO be/VB leave/VBN alone/RB ,/, so/RB I/PRP do/VBD not/RB exactly/RB draw/VB the/DT eye/NN ./. \n part/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN be/VBD a/DT heavy/JJ insecurity/NN about/IN my/PRP$ look/NNS ,/, so/CC I/PRP lord/VBD my/PRP$ \"/`` smart/NNS \"/'' over/IN other/JJ girl/NNS to/TO feel/VB well/JJR than/IN them/PRP ./. \n once/IN I/PRP hit/VBD about/RB 17/CD and/CC up/RB ,/, I/PRP find/VBD way/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN my/PRP$ emotional/JJ issue/NNS ,/, have/VBD finish/VBN some/DT acne/IN medication/NN ,/, and/CC choose/VBD more/JJR flattering/JJ clothe/NNS ./. \n I/PRP start/VBD to/TO get/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN attention/NN ,/, which/WDT help/VBD my/PRP$ insecurity/NNS (/-LRB- not/RB very/RB progressive/JJ ,/, but/CC that/DT be/VBZ the/DT truth/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC once/IN I/PRP start/VBD feel/VBG a/DT little/JJ well/JJR about/IN myself/PRP I/PRP realize/VBD what/WP a/DT hateful/JJ shit/NN I/PRP be/VBD and/CC how/WRB important/JJ kindness/NN be/VBZ ./. \n I/PRP start/VBD practice/VBG humility/NN and/CC throw/VBD in/RP a/DT little/JJ self/NN -/HYPH deprecate/VBG goofiness/NN to/TO make/VB myself/PRP approachable/JJ ./. \n I/PRP also/RB accept/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN my/PRP$ sexuality/NN be/VBD a/DT mess/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP quite/RB like/VBD other/JJ girl/NNS ,/, actually/RB ,/, but/CC still/RB have/VBD to/TO train/VB myself/PRP against/IN snap/JJ judgment/NNS on/IN them/PRP ./. \n and/CC I/PRP accept/VBD that/IN I/PRP have/VBP a/DT pretty/RB average/JJ intelligence/NN ./. \n I/PRP just/RB like/VBD to/TO read/VB ,/, so/RB my/PRP$ grammar/NN be/VBD a/DT step/NN above/IN my/PRP$ peer/NNS '/'' ./. \n", "gender": "Female", "raw_text": "I was definitely a \"not like other girls\" type in middle school & high school, but never to be the cool girl.

Part of the problem was a heavy insecurity about my looks, so I lorded my \"smarts\" over other girls to feel better than them. Once I hit about 17 and up, I found ways to deal with my emotional issues, had finished some acne medication, and chose more flattering clothes. I started to get a lot of attention, which helped my insecurities (not very progressive, but that's the truth), and once I started feeling a little better about myself I realized what a hateful shit I was and how important kindness is. I started practicing humility and threw in a little self-deprecating goofiness to make myself approachable. I also accepted the fact that my sexuality was a mess, and I quite liked other girls, actually, but still had to train myself against snap judgments on them.

Also, this is a throwaway account and I was an idiot when writing my name and typed throwaway instead of throwra.\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for 3 months now, so it's pretty new. So far everything is going well except this tiny little detail. He has this teddy bear, let's name him Teddy. Teddy has always been a part of my boyfriend's life : he got him for his birth and when at around the age of 5 or 6 (or whatever age is the appropriate age to remove a teddy bear from a child) his parents tried taking Teddy away from him, he screamt and cried so loud without stopping they ended up giving up. So he kept Teddy with him his whole life. \n\nHe mentionned Teddy to me pretty early, about a week after us being together. He showed me pictures of him and I found it cute at first. He had plenty of pictures of him in different situations (him with a mug, him laying in bed, him studying...). I truly found it adorable since I thought it was just a joke really and didn't think that Teddy was such a big part of his life. The more we got to know eachother the more he started mentionning him. He'd often make jokes about him. When he had to come back to his flat, he'd say \"I have to come back Teddy is waiting for me\" and then later he'd text me \"ok I put Teddy to bed so now I might go to sleep as well i don't want to wake him up\". Again, a little weird but cute still. But he really started talking about him constantly, always linking what we were doing to him (\"Oh I wish Teddy was with us to see that\", \"Teddy doesn't really like people so I won't take him with me for this party\" etc...) . He'd send me selfies with him at least twice a week.\n\nHe also sometimes said weird stuff like whenever we watched a sex scene in a movie he'd say \"that's what me and Teddy do when we're alone\" or when i asked when he lost his virginity he answered \"oh I lost it with Teddy a few years ago\". They were jokes that made me uncomfortable. He always seemt to consider him as a baby/his son/his brother, so him being sexualised was extremely weird for me. I told him then that it was weird and he just laughed but I don't think he took me seriously.\n\nAbout a month ago, I told him I was okay with him bringing Teddy when he was staying around my flat. I could see it was making him sad to leave him, and also was very curious to finally see him in person (I can't go to my boyfriend's flat, there are rules that are strict, he can't invite anyone). So that day I drove to his flat and he went with all his stuff and Teddy. When he got in the car he pulled him out from his bag and had him give me a kiss on the cheek. When we drove, he opened the window and put Teddy out of the car (a bit like a dog would). He said it was rare for Teddy to travel like that and he could feel that he was happy. Teddy smells a lot, my boyfriend hasn't washed him in 12 YEARS. For the rest of the car drive, he hugged him and gave him kisses.\n\nHe has weird \"twitch\" where he just compulsively pats the back of Teddy (it makes a weird sound because Teddy used to be able to play music when you pressed his belly). He always rubs Teddy's clothes inbetween his fingers (you can guess that Teddy is in a pretty bad state, he used to be red and now he's just grey). When we're together in bed, he always puts Teddy's mouth on my mouth and I always avoid it as I find it disgusting (and I told him that I hate it but he doesn't listen). He always tries to have Teddy touch my boobs or my arse. When we make love, I often end up finding him inbetween us and every time I throw him away my bf says \"oh no he likes to watch\" in a joking way. He often mentions us having a threesome with Teddy, him (Teddy) being great at licking, and them always doing kinky stuff together.\n\nNow I'm not an idiot. I know communication is important. I tried talking to him so many times. Sometimes in a joking way too so he doesn't feel attacked (like once, I asked who would he choose if he had to choose between me and Teddy, he said Teddy), but also so many times in a serious way (I told him I didn't like when he was rubbing Teddy on my face and body, I told him I found his relationship with him way too intense and weird) but every time he didn't take it seriously, made jokes, and never truly told me what he thought. I should mention that he is like that for any serious conversation, all he does is make awkward jokes and he never tells me how he feels (he said I love you first because he was drunk).\n\nThis is becoming hard to handle. I have been away from him for two weeks and was kind of relieved I wouldn't see Teddy anymore, but all he did was send pictures, and whenever I asked him \"what are you doing\" or \"what did you do today\" is answer was \"playing with Teddy\". Today he told me I was perfect, which was a first and I sure didn't expect that (he doesn't give a lot of compliment). When he said that I said \"really ?\" and his reply was \"actually no, Teddy is perfect, you come way after him\". I just gave up and didn't reply.\n\nI have 3 questions. 1) Am I overreacting, am I the one not being tolerant enough, am I some boring girlfriend who can't welcome some childishness in her couple ? 2) What should I do, should I let him live his life with Teddy, should I ask him to make a real choice, should I ask him to just stop the sexual jokes... Like, who am I to ask such things I don't know ? Is it my place to tell him to stop being so weird with his teddy bear ? And 3) How do I get him to finally talk to me and take me seriously ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR : my bf has a weird relationship with his teddy bear, he considers him as a baby/a son but still makes

Also, this is a throwaway account and I was an idiot when writing my name and typed throwaway instead of throwra. I have been with my boyfriend for 3 months now, so it's pretty new. So far everything is going well except this tiny little detail. He has this teddy bear, let's name him Teddy. Teddy has always been a part of my boyfriend's life : he got him for his birth and when at around the age of 5 or 6 (or whatever age is the appropriate age to remove a teddy bear from a child) his parents tried taking Teddy away from him, he screamt and cried so loud without stopping they ended up giving up. So he kept Teddy with him his whole life. He mentionned Teddy to me pretty early, about a week after us being together. He showed me pictures of him and I found it cute at first. He had plenty of pictures of him in different situations (him with a mug, him laying in bed, him studying...). I truly found it adorable since I thought it was just a joke really and didn't think that Teddy was such a big part of his life. The more we got to know eachother the more he started mentionning him. He'd often make jokes about him. When he had to come back to his flat, he'd say \"I have to come back Teddy is waiting for me\" and then later he'd text me \"ok I put Teddy to bed so now I might go to sleep as well i don't want to wake him up\". Again, a little weird but cute still. But he really started talking about him constantly, always linking what we were doing to him (\"Oh I wish Teddy was with us to see that\", \"Teddy doesn't really like people so I won't take him with me for this party\" etc...) . He'd send me selfies with him at least twice a week. He also sometimes said weird stuff like whenever we watched a sex scene in a movie he'd say \"that's what me and Teddy do when we're alone\" or when i asked when he lost his virginity he answered \"oh I lost it with Teddy a few years ago\". They were jokes that made me uncomfortable. He always seemt to consider him as a baby/his son/his brother, so him being sexualised was extremely weird for me. I told him then that it was weird and he just laughed but I don't think he took me seriously. About a month ago, I told him I was okay with him bringing Teddy when he was staying around my flat. I could see it was making him sad to leave him, and also was very curious to finally see him in person (I can't go to my boyfriend's flat, there are rules that are strict, he can't invite anyone). So that day I drove to his flat and he went with all his stuff and Teddy. When he got in the car he pulled him out from his bag and had him give me a kiss on the cheek. When we drove, he opened the window and put Teddy out of the car (a bit like a dog would). He said it was rare for Teddy to travel like that and he could feel that he was happy. Teddy smells a lot, my boyfriend hasn't washed him in 12 YEARS. For the rest of the car drive, he hugged him and gave him kisses. He has weird \"twitch\" where he just compulsively pats the back of Teddy (it makes a weird sound because Teddy used to be able to play music when you pressed his belly).

My university campus for my course is just down the road from their farm. Before I lived here, I had to drive an hour and a half to get to this campus. It's one of the best universities for the course because of how diverse the environment is close to the campus. Forrest, farm land, lakes etc. It's made my life a lot easier. \n\nMy boyfriend really isn't doing much since he dropped out of university last year. We're living on the farm rent free. My boyfriend really just sits around the house doing nothing. He only has the job of feeding the horses and putting them back in the barn. \n\nThree weeks ago, his father came banging on the door of our house/unit. He told my boyfriend to put his fucking shoes on and follow him. He took us to the paddock where the horses where. He wanted to know why they were left out all night and hadn't been fed. He pointed to Kyle (15M) taking the horses into the barn and told him that his younger brother is doing his job now. The last thing his father said is that it's his only fucking job to make sure they're warm and fed.

My boyfriend really isn't doing much since he dropped out of university last year. We're living on the farm rent free. My boyfriend really just sits around the house doing nothing. He only has the job of feeding the horses and putting them back in the barn. Three weeks ago, his father came banging on the door of our house/unit. He told my boyfriend to put his fucking shoes on and follow him. He took us to the paddock where the horses where. He wanted to know why they were left out all night and hadn't been fed. He pointed to Kyle (15M) taking the horses into the barn and told him that his younger brother is doing his job now.

She said that her having a child was a dealbreaker, I said it might have to be, and then things got a bit ugly. She's visiting family for the weekend and coming back on Sunday to \"discuss this further.\"", "selftext": "[Previous post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eilahp/my_girlfriend_23f_of_2_years_doesnt_want_kids/)\n\nI'm going to try and keep this post a little shorter than the previous one, I promise!\n\nI told her about my desire to have kids, and at first I don't think she thought I was seriously considering breaking up with her and was sympathetic and tried to make me feel better (lots of \"I love you so much, we'll figure this out, etc\"). She said that the dealbreaker was her having a kid, and I said I wanted to have a biological child of my own so it might have to be. She changed almost instantly and started swearing, saying \"this isn't fucking happening\", \"What the fuck, do you know who I am? I don't give second chances.\", and said she would take our 2 cats and all of her belongings (which  I said yes to and threw her off as she was expecting me to fight that), then berated me for wanting to bring a child into the world when there are already so many and how dare I force a woman to go through childbirth. She said I might not even be able to have kids because of my low testosterone (which is true, but irrelevant and a **very** low blow), tried to tell me how expensive kids are (which I already know) then pivoted and said she was open to adoption/surrogacy/fostering despite what she'd just said and her consistency the past 2 years in not wanting kids (and just a few minutes before she'd said that our parenting styles with the cats were so different that having a kid would probably tear us apart). \n\nAll of this ended with her saying that if I truly loved her I would fix this, and that I wasn't breaking up with her and she'd be back Sunday to \"discuss this further.\" before walking out and saying that she couldn't believe I'd brought this up and that she'd been looking forward to one of the long goodnight texts I used to send before we lived together.\n\nSo. I feel like I **probably** made the correct decision, given some of the things she said and how she reacted/twisted things. She also tried to make me out as a bad person by saying \"How dare you say that I either have to have your baby or break up with you.\" Which... I guess if you want to twist things around to make me look bad that's the way to do it. I didn't **want** to break up with her, but given her positions and my wants I don't see another way around it. I tried to be as cordial and calm as I could be the whole time. I had to ask her to stop firmly when she went into the low testosterone issue, but aside from that I mostly stuck to apologizing and trying to deal with her changing her stance/position every few minutes.\n\nHere's my questions this time:\n\n1. I've been in an abusive relationship before, and the phrase \"If you truly love me you'll fix this.\" sounds dangerously close to some of the things my ex used to say.

little shorter than the previous one, I promise! I told her about my desire to have kids, and at first I don't think she thought I was seriously considering breaking up with her and was sympathetic and tried to make me feel better (lots of \"I love you so much, we'll figure this out, etc\"). She said that the dealbreaker was her having a kid, and I said I wanted to have a biological child of my own so it might have to be. She changed almost instantly and started swearing, saying \"this isn't fucking happening\", \"What the fuck, do you know who I am? I don't give second chances.\", and said she would take our 2 cats and all of her belongings (which I said yes to and threw her off as she was expecting me to fight that), then berated me for wanting to bring a child into the world when there are already so many and how dare I force a woman to go through childbirth. She said I might not even be able to have kids because of my low testosterone (which is true, but irrelevant and a **very** low blow), tried to tell me how expensive kids are (which I already know) then pivoted and said she was open to adoption/surrogacy/fostering despite what she'd just said and her consistency the past 2 years in not wanting kids (and just a few minutes before she'd said that our parenting styles with the cats were so different that having a kid would probably tear us apart). All of this ended with her saying that if I truly loved her I would fix this, and that I wasn't breaking up with her and she'd be back Sunday to \"discuss this further.\" before walking out and saying that she couldn't believe I'd brought this up and that she'd been looking forward to one of the long goodnight texts I used to send before we lived together. So. I feel like I **probably** made the correct decision, given some of the things she said and how she reacted/twisted things. She also tried to make me out as a bad person by saying \"How dare you say that I either have to have your baby or break up with you.\" Which... I guess if you want to twist things around to make me look bad that's the way to do it. I didn't **want** to break up with her, but given her positions and my wants I don't see another way around it. I tried to be as cordial and calm as I could be the whole time. I had to ask her to stop firmly when she went into the low testosterone issue, but aside from that I mostly stuck to apologizing and trying to deal with her changing her stance/position every few minutes. Here's my questions this time: 1. I've been in an abusive relationship before, and the phrase \"If you truly love me you'll fix this.\" sounds dangerously close to some of the things my ex used to say. Is that actually as abusive as I feel it is, or am I letting my past experiences color my perception of this interaction too much? 2. I've basically made up my mind, especially with how she treated me and some of the things she said today. Yes, I know I hurt her (and dear god did I feel horrible about that), but she basically spent the better part of an hour berating me for wanting to have a child and tried very hard to spin me as a bad person/make me feel bad. That alone is enough in my books to merit the end of our relationship. That being said, I could use some advice on how to handle the \"continuation\" of this conversation come Sunday.

It never happened.", "selftext": "My wife and I have been married since we were very young (21/19). Our marriage has some minor issues, but more like \"slowly dying\" issues and not domestic violence issues. I've never posted here before and never thought something like this would happen to me. This incident occurred on New Year's Eve. \n\nWe were drinking and having a good time playing some card games and waiting for midnight with a group of friends. One of the guys made an off-color joke about domestic violence, to which one of the girls got (rightfully) offended because she had been a victim of DV in the past. He didn't mean anything by it and apologized, and we seemed to be moving on.\n\nSuddenly my wife blurts out: \"Jim slapped me once\". I looked at her expecting to hear some kind of joke, but she had a serious look on her face. Everyone was kind of puzzled, but then she told this story about how when we were first married that we got into a big fight and I supposedly lost my temper and slapped her in the face.\n\nThis never happened. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a violent person. I've never hit anyone. I've never even been in a fight in school. I'm the youngest and smallest of four brothers and would routinely get my ass kicked by them, so reacting violently to situations was never my thing. I've never even raised my voice at my wife, which is something she's always hated about me because she feels like I don't show emotion.\n\nMy friends (male and female) immediately jumped to my defense and said they didn't believe her. Even her own best friend who's known me as long as we've been married didn't seem to believe her.\n\nAt this point my wife gets upset at the fact that no one believes her and starts to cry. She then starts trying to justify the situation and said that she was the one who was hitting me first and that I responded by slapping her back. The first part is true as she did attack me physically several times  in the early years, but I thought we worked through that and nothing like it has happened in a long time. However, again, I NEVER struck her back.\n\nOne of our friends started talking about false memories and how sometimes we remember things differently as a kind of way to change the conversation. Naturally the party took a weird turn after that and everyone left right after midnight.\n\nThings between my wife and I have been tense. I tried to sit her down and talk to her about it, but she still insists that it happened and that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nThis is the first and only time she's made an accusation like this, and of course she does it in front of other people, including an actual DV victim. How should I approach this? Is it even possible to help her realize that it never happened? Is this a sign of something deeper, like maybe her setting herself up for divorce? I don't think she's the type, but before the other day I didn't think she would be the type to accuse me of this bullshit either.\n\nObviously, I'm deeply offended by this and expect an apology, but I can't even move on to that side of things as long as she keeps insisting it happened.

Our marriage has some minor issues, but more like \"slowly dying\" issues and not domestic violence issues. I've never posted here before and never thought something like this would happen to me. This incident occurred on New Year's Eve. We were drinking and having a good time playing some card games and waiting for midnight with a group of friends. One of the guys made an off-color joke about domestic violence, to which one of the girls got (rightfully) offended because she had been a victim of DV in the past. He didn't mean anything by it and apologized, and we seemed to be moving on. Suddenly my wife blurts out: \"Jim slapped me once\". I looked at her expecting to hear some kind of joke, but she had a serious look on her face. Everyone was kind of puzzled, but then she told this story about how when we were first married that we got into a big fight and I supposedly lost my temper and slapped her in the face. This never happened. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a violent person. I've never hit anyone. I've never even been in a fight in school. I'm the youngest and smallest of four brothers and would routinely get my ass kicked by them, so reacting violently to situations was never my thing. I've never even raised my voice at my wife, which is something she's always hated about me because she feels like I don't show emotion. My friends (male and female) immediately jumped to my defense and said they didn't believe her. Even her own best friend who's known me as long as we've been married didn't seem to believe her. At this point my wife gets upset at the fact that no one believes her and starts to cry. She then starts trying to justify the situation and said that she was the one who was hitting me first and that I responded by slapping her back. The first part is true as she did attack me physically several times in the early years, but I thought we worked through that and nothing like it has happened in a long time. However, again, I NEVER struck her back. One of our friends started talking about false memories and how sometimes we remember things differently as a kind of way to change the conversation. Naturally the party took a weird turn after that and everyone left right after midnight. Things between my wife and I have been tense. I tried to sit her down and talk to her about it, but she still insists that it happened and that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. This is the first and only time she's made an accusation like this, and of course she does it in front of other people, including an actual DV victim. How should I approach this? Is it even possible to help her realize that it never happened? Is this a sign of something deeper, like maybe her setting herself up for divorce? I don't think she's the type, but before the other day I didn't think she would be the type to accuse me of this bullshit either. Obviously, I'm deeply offended by this and expect an apology, but I can't even move on to that side of things as long as she keeps insisting it happened. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

Fairly big company with a large office. I enjoy my work and get along with everyone there. There are a few older, more experienced people who are team leaders and managers but most of us are young/under 30s. Out of us babies it's about 70/30 girls to guys. I generally hang out with the guys more. I don't dislike the girls but we don't have much in common (they're all graduates from top ranked places which I'm not.

Pretty much all of the younger set make fun of him except me (and I do tell the guys to chill out with it), but the managers really like him because of how dedicated he is. \n\nWe were back at work yesterday, and Mark stepped out for something.

months before last year's Christmas my wife gets upset with about not helping and that I should remember that \"acts or service\" was her love language and that me taking more initiative in household cleaning chores would help. Admittedly, I had been slacking and made it a point to step up my game. I did and she said even told me so. Now fast forward to that Christmas. We typically have a rule that for Christmas and birthdays we give gifts that the other person wouldn't buy for themselves. But for that Christmas, she wanted to get less expensive gifts. Which would have been fine if she taken the time consider a good gift. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in my gifts. One was bottle of body wash called Ballwash and the other was a $50 gift card. I should mention that my love language is \"receiving gifts\" and this hurt me on a couple levels. One was that we had not been intimate in several months and I immediately took this as her making fun of that. Which in turn was making fun of me. Another was that I thought she changed our Christmas tradition just so she did not have to think about anything I liked doing. She couldn't be bothered to spend anytime thinking about me or what I liked doing. I carried that pain/anger/hurt for over a month. I was so mad at her, I contemplated ruining her birthday by giving her some equally awful gift. But my better judgement prevailed and I sat her down to talk about it. There were some tears and misty eyes but I had to tell her or I would have never let it go. During that conversation I told her that for my birthday (which is a fast follow after Christmas) I wanted a particular accessory for one of my hobbies. Now while she didn't exactly what I wanted, she at least tried. Now let's get to this past Christmas. In order to avoid the previous Christmas' fiasco, I started sending Christmas lists to her on the regular. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc. There were plenty of highly detailed and specific gifts of varying price points. And since I started sending them to her in September, she had plenty of time to fit me in her schedule. Now since we share an Amazon account, I can see whenever she orders something. I knew she was getting me a particular tool off the list not only from the order confirmation but she asked me about it two days before that. I was feeling a little down that the surprise was ruined but I was getting a new tool. Christmas day rolls around and it's my turn to open gifts. New tool? Yup. Sweet. I'm thinking that's it because typically stockings are just decoration. But she had our two year old run mine to me. Inside was a map with instructions on where to find the next gift. So me and my son go on a scavenger hunt for all these little gifts scattered around the house. The last gift was a gift card for the accessory I had wanted the previous Christmas. She even said she got similar one at a local store but returned it when she did a little more research into it thinking that it was wrong. She asked me if the first one was correct and I told her either would have been fine. I teared up a little because she did a fantastic job of making me feel special and that she actually was willing to put in the time for me. She showed me that affection is not a one way street and she was willing to do the things that would make me happy. I'm still giddy about it becuase it was so much fun.

that said, all brains are wired differently and thus require different amounts of mental energy or effort to take part in social interaction, or are more or less sensitive too it. People who are more sensitive to interaction or who require more mental effort to take part in it will often begin to feel drained from it, the same way long hours of menial tasks at an office cubicle may wear on others. I have two metaphors that I have found to be very well received when explaining to my students and friends: 1. All people have skin, and Most people enjoy massages or gentle head rubs. But anyone would say that rubbing the exact same spot for 16 hours straight would make the skin feel raw and sensitive, possibly slightly painful. And there are some with very delicate skin who will reach that point after only an hour or two. It\u2019s not that they suddenly hate being massaged, it\u2019s just that the slight wear on the skin has gotten to a point where they need to take a break from getting rubbed. 2. Everyone needs social interaction, but are sensitive to it on a wide variety of levels. Imagine a large barrel that can be filled with water; this will represent our \u201csocial interaction\u201d tank. This tank has a small leak in the bottom, so it must be occasionally topped up. But if you fill it up too much, it overflows and makes a mess everywhere and can be quite the pain to clean up. Many tanks have tops on them, with maybe just a few small holes through which rainwater can enter; this makes them less \u201csensitive\u201d to the rainwater. Other tanks may have giant holes or no top at all, so rainwater may flow freely into the barrel; making them far more sensitive to rainfall. 6 hours of rain may be a perfect amount to fill a tank with small holes, while the open tank may have started overflowing and making a mess after just 1 hour. It would be better if we could move the open barrel out of the rain after it fills up quickly, so as to avoid making a mess. It will still need to be topped off later as the water slowly leaks out, but RIGHT NOW more water is just making a mess and the barrel needs to be out of the rain for a while. You may be your significant other\u2019s favorite \u201cwater\u201d, but too much is too much no matter where it comes from. Just as too much social interaction will make a brain that is more sensitive to it feel raw and sore, or overflowing and out of control."}]
